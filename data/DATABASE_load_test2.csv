Subawardees had submitted review and updates prior to meeting. Covid guidelines were discussed and updated. Collaborative opportunities were shared. Pyxis has secured a speaker for CenterLink's geonomics-focused podcast proposed to be recorded in March, 2022. That introduction will be held in January, 2022. PMT links are encouraged to be shared everywhere. ","Clarification was requested for the use and sharing of PMT link and QR code in the NY Regional Market. Local direction was in conflict with Pyxis guidance. This has seens been cleared up with direction for all subawardees to share links, etc, in all areas. Changing covid guidelines at the local level are still restricting planned collaborative events in the Detroit Regional Market.

CenterLink organized a coreographed posting of assets across all subawardees and our partners at PRIDEnet/Stanford. Our goal is to identify how/if the content, manner of posting, hastags used, and how other same details may be accepted by some social media postings and rejected by others. Results will be gathered during the January 2022 subawardee meeting. ","CenterLink is grateful for the support and flexibility of Pyxis around guidance, direction overall, and monthly report submission to accomodate our member centers and CenterLink holiday schedules.",,,,"Conversations with Community - Naseema Shafi, Monday, December 1, 2021, 10-11am ET
