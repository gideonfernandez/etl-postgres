We hosted an Enrollment Information Session for our student ambassadors and THEARI All of Us staff on April 19th with Banner Health. This session better informed us as to how formal enrollment works at an HPO. THEARI was also a part of the NAO Student Panel on April 20th in which Ciauna represented THEARI and shared with over 50 attendees her experience as a student ambassador. We featured all five of our student ambassadors in the April newsletter. We submitted a successful Engagement Strategy as well.","","We have not identified any barriers to participation, in fact, we have seen an increase in participation. We believe we have been able to increase our promotion and education for the All of Us Research Program through our student ambassadors' activities and also offering hybrid attendance options when possible for activities.","N/A","Challenges experienced this month relate to enrollment. We have spent the last month or more trying to better understand the enrollment process in the Denver Market and have finally reached a point in which we feel like we know how to approach this topic! We appreciate the support from Julia and Gabi in trying to navigate the appropriate enrollment pathways and what is allowable for internal and external use. Our THEARI All of Us team is much more confident in providing the foundational knowledge about enrollment to interested participants in All of Us and we feel we have the right tools to point people in the right direction.","An important lesson learned this month is that we don't have all the answers as a CPGI partner, nor should we. In an attempt to make clearer the enrollment pathways, we have realized that while we are the first line of communication for many interested individuals in All of Us, we don't need to have all the answers. It has become incredibly clear that we need  definite calls to action in our potential FY23 cycle so we can better meet our internal goals and respect the educational reach we have.","This month's activities included two student ambassador activities, Spring Engagement Meeting preparations with Texas Waco AHEC, check-ins with student ambassadors, Journey Bus meeting with Montage, AHEC Community Meeting, internal THEARI team meeting, Denver Market meeting, meeting with Banner Health, Enrollment Information Session with Banner Health for student ambassadors and THEARI All of Us staff, NAO Student Panel, meeting with YMCA of Metro Denver, two, 1:1 check-ins with Julia, and ongoing marketing with a monthly newsletter and social media posts (reports provided separately).","Best resonating messages came out of Ciauna's activity on April 8th. Her audience had great questions about the All of Us Research Program, including: Is there data available for the Native American population? How rigorous is the genomic testing in All of Us? Who controls the data from fitness devices? Does the participant submit the data to NIH, or does it get sent from the company (e.g. Apple) to NIH? These questions have been addressed by Pyxis Partners and highlight the importance of us as a CPGI partner being able to admit when we do not have the answers but seek them out for interested participants in the program.","N/A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a barrier to participation because THEARI will be unable to serve as the host for future All of Us student ambassadors but believes in the power of student engagement in this program.

""The event was definitely a success, and we reached out to many people! Dr. Michael Bradfield & Kaylee Hambek from Banner Health were absolutely fantastic and very experienced. Kaylee was in front of the booth, engaging people coming by, and many people trusted in Dr. Bradfield since he was a physician providing insight into personalized medicine.""

Reach of this post is expected to increase as it is continuing to run through April 30th.

LAMDA assisted with registering 35 individuals by hosting an event in collaboration with two HPOs—Northwestern University (NU) and University of Chicago Illinois (UCI). NU registered 12 individuals and UCI registered 23 individuals. While there was a logistical challenge that required participants to enter the LAMDA office to receive educational materials versus them being provided at the All of Us van brought by UCI, this was still a successful event.

One success story in particular included two Latina/x women (ages 52 and 64) that registered for the event then received follow up from NU and UCI for enrollment at the event. They reported to LAMDA their excitement to join the All of Us Research Program. Both women provided blood samples and are interested in learning more about their DNA. They completed consent forms to receive follow up by the HPOs.","","Barriers to participation including a distrust in providing personal health information continued to be expressed this month. Additionally, challenges with access to technology and digital literacy continued to be a barrier to participation among older adults, including individuals not having an email address required to sign up.","LAMDA reported that event attendees expressed concern when providing health information that they could receive a false diagnoses of a health condition.","Challenges for participant engagement continued to remain constant in regards to participants feeling discouraged because of the travel required to participate. Participants have concerns about going to health centers (enrollment centers) they are not familiar with.","Mexican Coalition reflected on the decrease in social media interactions this month and identified that social media posts that provide more specific information about the program have higher engagement than posts with general information. There was also higher social media interaction on past months’ posts that were specifically targeting women than this month’s more general posts. Mexican Coalition expressed the need for expansion of social media assets and toolkits with more specific or targeted messages that would be better received by their community.","We participated in our monthly call with UnidosUS team leads with our engagement and communications counselors, held internal meetings, and held one-on-one calls with both of our subgrantees, and communicated with subgrantees on subsequent calls about scheduling and reporting processes. We also held calls with the Chicago HPO and New York HPO to explore collaboration opportunities, one which already resulted in the successful in person event in Chicago.","Throughout the month, LAMDA reported that their participants are excited about the advancement in medicine for the Hispanic community. They want this program to succeed in achieving personalized medicines and prevention specifically for future generations. One woman shared that she has arthritis and hopes that this program will allow her daughter to know if she is predisposed to her condition. Other resonating messages included learning more about DNA and genetics, disease prevention, and learning risk factors for diseases.","LAMDA recognized that participation throughout this month included members of the general public agent 18-64.

A booth, and a 5 minute presentation as part of the main program.

This month the time was allocated to planning and working through logistics and details for this event. The finalized plan will be a manned booth, to tell the crowd about the All of Us program, and to encourage sign ups. The booth will have promotional give-aways, and 3 different flyers so attendees can also find out more information later. There will be two NIH personnel on hand to help explain the program.

The 5-minute program will feature 2 1-minute duration videos, and two of the society members (Raju Shah and Rahul Jain) discussing the program, the society's involvement, and encouraging members to learn more and to sign up. The program will feature members from the All Of Us. A backdrop in the form a PPT Slide was designed, with a QR Code for the audience to find out more details, by going to the Join Us page for All of Us.","","","","","","In addition one of the JSMW Team (Pavan Zaveri) attended the DMV Market Call on 4/19 and discussed the above event.","A large portion of this month was spent planning our society's first in person event since COVID, scheduled for 5/1.

At a high level the event is an auditorium-based program, several hours in duration, and then followed by a community wide dinner. The event will be at Paint Branch High School.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

HACU also signed an addendum with Pyxis for an additional activity for this cycle to convene HSI community colleges in June for an informative session in collaboration with the Pyxis team. This month, we met with Kim Cantor to discuss the activity and began brainstorming, planning and coordinating the convening of HSI Community Colleges that will serve as a virtual roundtable discussion to education higher education institutions about the All of Us program and how to obtain DURA's with the program. HACU is currently gathering a list of institutions and will begin reaching out to campuses in May for the convening to occur in June. In the month of April, HACU also met with our engagement counselor for our biweekly check-in calls. We also connected with our communications counselor at one of the biweekly meetings to discuss communication needs, updates and progress.","","NA","NA","","","The HACU team conducted several internal meetings to discuss the strategy for the next All of Us cycle.

During this month LULAC was planning for the upcoming in-person cafecito in June regarding mental health. LULAC had originally planned this cafecito for May for Mental Health Awareness Month, however we experienced a few challenges with securing a space and partners in a timely manner. At the suggestion of Rima, LULAC has moved our cafecito to June 25 but will still focus on mental health as it’s an issue that should be amplified in minority communities.  LULAC also participated in the Spring Engagement Meeting and CPGI Meeting this month to better understand what other CPGI partners are doing across various markets. Additionally, LULAC made minor revisions to our CPGI Strategy Plan and submitted it to our engagement counselor through the feedback provided by the evaluation committee. We are currently awaiting next steps for the SOW development and timeline. 
Finally, Rima and the LULAC team have been discussing the execution plan for the 2022 LULAC National Convention that is taking place in San Juan, PR in late July.  We have discussed outreach and exhibiting and speaking opportunities.","","n/a","n/a","A challenge LULAC experienced during this month was finalizing the Mental Health Cafecito. For the month of May, LULAC had an in-person cafecito planned for the DMV market. However, we experienced challenges in finalizing a site location and participating partners.","There had been some confusion last month when submitting the social media and monthly reports through Network Ninja 2.0.  During the month of May, LULAC’s Health Programs Coordinator learned how to use Network Ninja 2.0. The Programs Coordinator had a quick training session with LULAC’s engagement counselor, Rima Matsumoto on how to use the new platform.","LULAC had meetings with the All of Us team throughout the month of May to discuss how to pivot the Mental Health Cafecito. Additionally, we requested support from Samantha in drafting talking points and creating social media graphics for the Mental Health Awareness Month Cafecito that will take place on June 25, 2022 in the DMV. There will be two sessions for this cafecito event– one will be in Spanish and the other in English. LULAC shared this opportunity with other CPGI partners in the DMV market call and there has been expressed interest in collaborating on this event. LULAC attended the DMV market call on May 17th and shared information about the cafecito event to other CPGI partners for an opportunity to collaborate. LULAC will also be attending the Chicago market call on May 31st. In addition to those meetings, earlier this month LULAC attended the Spring Engagement Meeting. The workshops were very informative and interesting. LULAC also attended the CPGI Meeting. It was interesting to learn more about what strategies and models worked for other CPGI partners. It was also interesting to learn about how the data is collected and given back to the CPGI partners to have a better understanding of their impact.","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We have decided to keep our current format of the table talk series, with one change. We will be focused on health outcomes, as such we plan to include a doctor, researcher, and patient. We are shoring up partnerships with HPOs with the goal of having one partner for each event. Our plan includes keeping the events virtual except for one live event, should we be able to do an in-person event. We have had preliminary conversations with speakers for each event, with a confirmation for the first event. We continue to support the events hosted by BGLC organization as well as the Rooted in Resilience event hosted in Atlanta via Facebook live.","","","","Awareness of All of Us is a wonderful opportunity to engage in selfcare on a deeper level. The challenges we face relates to how to develop informative information that highlights the purpose of the All of Us program as well as engage our community in selfcare and personal health advocacy. All of Us program participation is an important tool, that could be used to help our community members understand how to advocate for themselves. This is the primary reason why we have decided to update our table talk series to ensure that we include a researcher, a doctor, and a patient. This is the new format we will use going forward.","The theme for this month’s lessons includes end use experience with the program, which directly informs how we develop our table talk. A member of the team who is a participant in the program, had an extensive conversation about the Social Determinants of Health Survey in the portal. According to the representative, they were reaching out to people who had not completed the survey to get it completed as well as understand their hesitation with completing the survey. It seems that although there have been great strides in getting people engaged, there is still work to do in keeping people engaged in the activities and the project.   This helped our team members have a greater understanding about the direction of the program and our work with All of Us.","This month we participated in all BGLC Meetings. We participated in our weekly planning meetings for NPHC. We participated in and supported events hosted by other BGLC organizations. We reviewed the CPGI New Cycle Planning packet, where we noted with interest that Chicago is on the list of market cities. Finally, we engaged with an HPO in a discussion about the participant experience specifically as it relates to the Social Determinants of Health Survey. This conversation was held by a team member is a participant with the HPO where they are signed up.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We remained in communication with the Pyxis team, with regular follow-up/check-ins, and they assisted us in identifying a new speaker.","We received more tangible evidence that the All of Us program is of interest to the PA audience, based on the audience engagement during our Women in Philanthropy webinar event on precision medicine and women's health. Audience members asked questions after the presentation that indicated interest in learning more and potentially getting involved. We also received outreach from a PA expressing his interest in getting more involved in the program in a direct way.","Governance activities this month included our monthly internal check-in meeting and other planning conversations and coordination regarding program assets for upcoming events.

Meetings included: 
Internal check-in meeting - 4/12; 
Planning/run-through call for student symposium - 4/12; 
Participation in AoU Researchers Convention - 3/31-4/1.","An article and series of social media posts highlighting a PA who works in genetic medicine generated high levels of engagement. Genetic medicine is a lesser-know/less common practice area for PAs, and seemed to spark interest among our audience. We tied All of Us messaging into the article to provide an overview of the program and encourage PAs interested in genetics to consider getting involved, including on the research side.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We hosted several virtual, drive-thru, and some in-person events with all of our partners across Dallas and Houston Texas and Louisiana with virtual events extending into many other States as well. 

In Dallas, Community Council hosted a series of virtual events, such as ""Healthy Cooking"" and TSU’s ""Medical Mistrust and Vaccine Hesitancy"" each one focused on educating and empowering communities to achieve better health and wellness by introducing them to the All of Us Research Program. We also participated in a local food bank, with our Community Relations Manager, Patricia Johnson, attending to help out the community, while informing them about the All of Us Research Program. 

In Houston, the Harris County Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection Aging and Disability Resource Center, collaborated with Wellsville YMCA to do a Healthy Living Class. They discussed healthy recipes that are easy to make. For the participants, they made a turkey wrap with cranberries and discussed the vulnerable population, and chronic disease. They also discussed All of Us and how to join the research project. They encouraged each participant to tell their doctors about the All of Us Research Program.  At the end of the session, All of Us face masks were distributed.  

In New Orleans, the New Orleans Council on Aging continues to provide information regarding All of Us to Senior Centers as they continue to re-open and increase their population. They will also be collaborating with additional partners next month, such as Dillard University and LSU, in order to advance education of the All of Us Research Program.

In Shreveport, the Caddo Council on Aging held some drive-thru wellness events. Participants were able to receive information about resources and services offered in Caddo Parish. Individuals were also be able to receive COVID vaccines and information about the All of Us Research Program.

In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Agency on Aging hosted some outreach events, as well as continue posting ""All of Us"" blog posts on their home page. They were also able to deliver some All of Us material to seniors in East Feliciana Parish. They also are continuing to plan an event with Pennington and the YMCA for May (Date subject to change)","","","","COVID continues to be the main challenge across all our partners, but with more and more restrictions being lifted, we are starting to plan more in-person events.

The center continues to develop a better understanding of how AHECs can support the All of Us program through our experience and the opportunities provided by Pyxis to collaborate with AHEC/THEARI and the WA Ecosystem.","","The main challenge is capacity at this time.  However, the AHEC is actively working to address this issue.","Center capacity has been a challenge this year.  It was expected that center staff would need to be flexible to delivery of media work on virtual and in-person events.  However, the challenges of staffing and hiring during the pandemic were new with many organizations in the AHEC network impacted by the great resignation.  This had internal implications, but also impacted AHEC external partners and contacts. 

The AHEC hired two more part-time hourly staff in March and spent time onboarding and training during the month of April.  This was challenging to administer during our planned travel months for the All of Us Program, but also a positive for the center. Lesly Pumay was added to the All of Us program grant work at the center to support social media work. She is graduating this year with a BFA in Design from Cornish College of Arts.  The AHECWW working diligently to launch a social media campaign as a part of our All of Us grant before the close of the fiscal year. 

The center also interviewed candidates and hired one new full-time position to start in May. These efforts will significantly improve center capacity across grant work. The AHECWW continues to push forward identifying strategies to maintain and deliver grant tasks to the best of staff ability and capacity, while addressing any deficiencies","During the Western Forum, Cori Garcia Hansen became ill with an upper respiratory infection.  She was then not allowed to participate in the in-person conference.  However, the AHECWW center sent two staff, so Carlos Morales, was able to cover the event activities.  The AHECWW also had the support of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health.  Overall, the task was delivered successfully.   

As the AHECWW looks forward to the opportunity to continue participation with the All of Us Program, the center has reflected on its niche and role in the work in the WA Ecosystem.  The education and awareness piece seems complimentary to the work to build support among health professionals working in underserved communities.  Ultimately, this will help with recruitment and retention.  We also continue to provide information about the research work bench to the health professions student and professional audience. The AHEC needs to learn more about how to best evaluate and survey participants in programming to serve the other collaborative efforts in the region and goals of the program.  As the development of the WA Ecosystem group is new, the center is optimistic about the opportunities to collaborate and form a streamlined approach with tangible outcomes in support of regional partners.","With the ongoing challenges during the pandemic, the experience with event coverage demonstrated the importance of back-up plans and staffing when unforeseen factors like illness impact the work.","The AHECWW participated in the CPGI Engagement Counseling meeting and the National AHEC Organization All of Us Program presentation. These meetings were very helpful in event prep and with  completing the AHECWW  New Cycle Planning Packet.  The AHECWW did not attend the AHEC/THEARI meeting, as this was during the Western Forum. This meeting time was used for the other AHECs to practice for their collaborative presentation on the student ambassador program, which the AHECWW currently does not provide.","Thus far, the AHECWW is finding that participant engagement best-resonating messages are about opportunities to engage in research.  This makes sense, as AHECs primarily work with students and health professionals who are passionate about service to underserved communities and improving healthcare for these populations.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

NHMA also began to plan the Cinco de Mayo office housewarming event where we plan to distribute All of Us materials that we had in surplus from the NHMA Annual Conference. Registration and promotion has already begun.

The NHMA programs and communications team completed the deliverable of incorporating two webpages about All of Us into our new resource hub, HispanicHealth.info. NHMA developed two pages to target different target audiences within our network. One page was developed for patients and one was developed for researchers and physicians. Both pages were carefully crafted to contain easily digestible text and visual images that helped to break down the program. On the patient side, we focused on keeping the information culturally competent and at a health literacy level that matches our communities needs. This page broke down how to join the program step by step and what the journey looks like with images along the way. The provider side consisted of information about the program that could be relayed to their patients, privacy concerns, and also how they can join as researchers. NHMA worked closely with our EC and  our Account Supervisor from the Clyde group to ensure proper protocols and messaging were executed.
Patient Side: https://hispanichealth.info/all-of-us-participants/
Provider Side: https://hispanichealth.info/all-of-us-providers/

In preparation for the new cycle, NHMA also reached out to chapter leaders in target markets to gauge interest in the program and participating in events for the new cycle. NHMA received interest from 3 chapters in Texas, Arizona, and California,  and received interest from 3 physician researchers to be potential spokespersons. NHMA also established a connection with Mary's Center in DC for potential collaboration opportunities for the new cycle.","","","","NHMA faced the challenge of having to elaborate on the engagement strategy document for how we would track researcher engagement and outcomes. We revised our approach and potential outcomes to align with the program's goals and hope to receive more feedback and strategies for enhancing this activity.","This month, NHMA learned the importance of establishing partnerships for collaborations with HPO's in our target market areas and where we have chapters. We also learned the importance of planning in advance with chapters and interested physicians/researcher to get them involved with our scope of work for the upcoming project period.","On April 6, 2022, NHMA's core project team, including President & CEO, Dr. Elena Rios, met with our EC to discuss the engagement strategy document. During the call, we discussed best practices for submissions, collaborations with local HPO's in the DMV, and tracking researcher and participant engagement using coded target market links.

On April 12 and April 19, 2022, NHMA was present for the New York Target Market Call and the DMV Target Market Call. NHMA shared our recent conference and our upcoming Cinco de Mayo event on the DMV Call. NHMA and Mary's Center connected via email after the call for potential partnerships. The organizations will be meeting during the week of May 2nd. NHMA invited our EC to the call.

On April 20, 2022, NHMA staff met with our EC and Jakara Eason to discuss the possibility of hosting an event in our new office space in June. Planning has  begun and NHMA is meeting internally to decide on a date for the provider roundtable. NHMA plans to have Dr. Elena Rios participate as a speaker and also plans to help promote the event to our networks and local chapter.

The painting created by Mr. Searius Addishin was presented as a gift to BGLC Coordinator Ms. Jennifer Jones as a tribute for all of the hard work she has put in over the years.  In addition to the artists, the conversation with former International Grand Polaris Robert M.

We also met with the BGLC leadership about our next proposed phase of activities.  The focus we have in mind, after reading the 5-year mission of the program, is on Gerontology and our Elder population.  The reasoning behind this is that we have a lot of older brothers in our fraternity (one more living Founder) and it’s time we begin to talk about being there for them during this time of need.  Thinking of this makes it even more important that we educate the public about the importance of Precision Medicine and taking care of our loved ones in their Golden Years.

In regard to information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us DNA Day and World Health Day social media toolkits through our platforms. NRHA also discussed a potential paid co-branded Facebook opportunity with our engagement counselor, , communications counselor, and internal NRHA staff. Further, NRHA was able to share with its sub-awardees a social media analytics tracking form that is enhancing NRHA’s social media reporting in Network Ninja.  

In Colorado, our sub-awardee the Colorado Rural Health Center (CRHC) held their Annual Rural Health Forum April 6-8, 2022. The Forum provided an opportunity for Colorado’s 55 certified Rural Health Clinics, and other rural providers and healthcare professionals interested in learning more about rural specific healthcare to convene, learn, and network together. NRHA and CRHC wanted to take the opportunity to educate rural providers on what the Program is and why it is safe and important to participate in the All of Us Research Program. NRHA, with the help of our engagement counselor, was able to coordinate an All of Us presence at the Forum, which consisted of Denver Market Coordinator Julia Daverne giving an oral presentation on the AoU Research Program, as well as Ms. Daverne hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit space. It was reported back to NRHA by CRHC that after the Forum, 50% of survey respondents said they would like more sessions on diversity and inclusion in the future, which was a central topic in the AoU Research Program session. Please see the Network Ninja activities log for more information about the exhibit and the session.  Finally, here are highlights Ms. Daverne also shared upon return from the Forum:  

“I just returned from an amazing trip to Denver, CO to speak and exhibit at the Colorado Rural Health Center Forum. I met attendees from various professional backgrounds which included providers/MDs/nurses, a hospital CEO, clinic directors...etc. I had great introductory conversations about the All of Us program while exhibiting. 19 attendees were in my session which was great given the average was about 15 for concurrent sessions. I met many of the attendees at the table and incorporated their stories into the presentation. It was great learning about rural populations! I met Amanda Quintana with NAHN, who was awesome to meet in person. She attended the AoU session and added great supportive AoU commentary to the discussion.” 

On April 25th, NRHA subawardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, in accordance with their goals to have a larger social media presence, participated in the DNA Day Twitter Chat with the University of Shreveport in the Shreveport, LA Market. LRHA also shared the All of Us social media observances in April. Those social media engagements have/will be entered into Network Ninja.  

In the El Paso, TX Target Market, Krista Forbes, target market coordinator, has assisted NRHA in identifying existing CHW AoU materials. While NRHA had anticipated being further along in the development of a rural CHW training related to AoU in Cycle 3, we encountered some unforeseen challenges and therefore reallocated some funding to support All of Us Research Program’s presence at NRHA’s Annual Conference.  NRHA has contracted with Janel Lowman, a CHW trainer who has worked with rural CHWS and is familiar with the Program through her position with the University of South Alabama, to develop an outline for rural CHW training from the existing All of Us Research Program slide decks with the sole purpose of educating rural CHWs about the Program. Upon successful completion of this outline in Cycle 3, NRHA proposes to build upon the outline in Cycle 4 to create AoU Research Program training modules for rural CHWs.  

As noted in the previous reports, NRHA is delighted to have Dr. Watson present the Terry Reilly Keynote at the NRHA 2022 Annual Rural Health Conference on Thursday, May 12, 2022 in Albuquerque, NM. We continue to work with our engagement counselor and communications lead to coordinate the All of Us presence at the Annual Conference. Since Dr. Watson is attending the Annual Rural Health Conference, NRHA has been working with CPGI Partner Texas AHEC East, Waco office to finalize details for the co-hosted exhibit. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla will be helping to support this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, if needed. NRHA also plans to engage conference participants directly after Dr. Watson’s presentation to take any additional questions or comments they may have about the AoU Research Program by holding “Ask Me a Question” signs outside of the auditorium. The plans and efforts continue to be ongoing as the date of the Annual Conference is approaching. NRHA has ordered all of the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco will be providing the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla will meet with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference. 

In April, NRHA has been in conversation with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett about coordinating an online seminar based around the All of Us Research Program’s Workbench. This would take place before the end of Cycle 3 – likely in June 2022.  

In Arizona, this month, NRHA met with AZ Rural Health Association leadership to discuss their activities as collaborators for the remainder of Cycle 3 and their interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as subawardees and participants in the developing Arizona Target Market. From this conversation, AzRHA proposed hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit at an upcoming rural health conference in June that AZRHA is co-sponsoring (48th Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference). NRHA and our engagement counselor believe that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Program to Arizona rural health stakeholders. AZRHA is currently working on a Cycle 3 proposal to include this new activity. Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a subawardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. They mentioned having a podcast series in which they would be happy to feature information and figures from the Program to familiarize their audience with the Program. They suggested maybe including other California CPGI, HPO, or National Partners on the podcast. NRHA is waiting to hear back from the president, who was seeking approval from the full CSRHA Board.","","NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general.","There are challenges that we hope to explore in Cycle 4: When working with trusted community partners like providers or other groups, what type of information do they need to feel comfortable sharing about the importance of enrollment in the AoU Program? What would make a provider recommend this program to a patient? How can NRHA assist in coordinating these types of discussions between rural providers and the Program? How can NRHA better identify UBR groups within rural (I.e., someone who is a person of color living in rural America or an LGBTQ+ person living in rural America), essentially how do we take into better account the intersectional identities of people that cause them to be further underrepresented in biomedical precision research?","NRHA was hoping to All of Us Research Program promotional giveaways at the CRHC 2022 Forum,   unfortunately there was a technical glitch that caused the order not to be processed. When the CRHC order modification was submitted in the system, it did not alert the appropriate staff person as it was designed to do; therefore that the modified was not processed. NRHA was alerted by our engagement counselor that the items did not get shipped in time because of the glitch. NRHA and Pyxis have decided to ship those giveaways to a future NRHA or subawardee in-person All of Us event. We appreciate our engagement counselor and the system monitor’s help in figuring out the issue and working to correct it in the system.  

As mentioned in the accomplishments section, NRHA had planned to have developed the rural community health worker training activity further this cycle, but staff transition and the realization that the type of CHW materials we were looking for did not exist, have delayed our progress on this activity. However, a CHW trainer is now developing an outline for a CHW training using the approved AoU Research Program slide deck. We plan to build upon that work in our proposed scope of work for Cycle 4. In consultation with our engagement counselor, funding that had been set aside for the CHW trainer was reallocated to support AoU’s session at NRHA’s Annual Conference.","NRHA has learned that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals can lead to success! On the other side of this lesson is that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals requires patience, flexibility, and open communication. Unfortunately, we were unable to have the promotional giveaways at the Forum, but now have also learned an important lesson to follow up after submission to confirm receipt and that there is always a way to repurpose materials.","Between March, 31, 2022, and April 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Researchers Convention, all Cycle 4 planning meetings and all other virtual events held by the Program.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

In Dallas, Community Council hosted a series of events, we held the last segment of our ""Healthy Cooking"" virtual show, as well as two in-person events “Family Fit Fest” and “Cinco de Mayo Celebration” focused on educating and empowering communities to achieve better health and wellness by introducing them to the All of Us Research Program and other resources. 

In Houston, the Harris County Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection Aging and Disability Resource Center, collaborated with St. Matthews Church. “Coffee and Croissants”, ADRC discussed how the Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection utilizes All of Us Research Project to connect with the community.  We discussed the vulnerable population, and chronic disease. We also discussed All of Us and how to join the research project. We encouraged each participant to tell their doctors about All of Us as well as handed out masks.  

In New Orleans, the New Orleans Council on Aging continues to provide information regarding All of Us to Senior Centers as they continue to re-open and increase their population. They will also be collaborating with additional partners next month, such as Xavier University and LSU, in order to advance education of the All of Us Research Program.

In Shreveport, the Caddo Council on Aging held some drive-thru wellness events. Participants were able to receive information about resources and services offered in Caddo Parish. Individuals were also be able to receive COVID vaccines and information about the All of Us Research Program.

In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Agency on Aging hosted some outreach events, as well as continue posting ""All of Us"" blog posts on their home page. They were also able to deliver some All of Us material to seniors in East Feliciana Parish.","","","","Remaining COVID restrictions continue to be the main challenge across all our partners, but with more and more restrictions being lifted, we are starting to plan more in-person events. In the meantime, we continue to host virtual events promoting the All of Us Research Program.","As always, we continue to learn of more engaging ways to work alongside different organizations and communities.

Throughout this project year, we are learning to be creative and innovative in our methods of fostering new partnerships. We are also learning to be resourceful and to think outside of the box when it comes to capturing the attention of the community.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

During this month LULAC was planning for the upcoming in-person cafecito in May for Mental Health Awareness Month. LULAC began looking for potential venues and partner organizations in the DMV area. LULAC is just awaiting confirmation on the location from our potential co-host in order to confirm the date in June. Additionally, we have developed a final list of potential speakers that we are also reaching out to for the invitation to join our panels and began discussing with Samantha Santoro, our communications counselor our needs for promotional materials.  During the DMV market call on April 19, 2022 LULAC shared information regarding the in-person cafecito and opportunities for collaboration. Additionally, during this month LULAC worked on the CPGI Strategy Plan to submit by the April 8, 2022 deadline. With Rima’s guidance, we were able to align LULAC’s strategies with the All of Us Research program’s 5 year goals to continue our collaborations and set the vision for future work plans.  

As the 2022 LULAC National Convention logistics are underway, we have had initial conversations of the execution to the event.  This includes potential areas of collaboration, outreach, and addressing attendees by All of Us representatives to create multiple touch points for the program. 

The LULAC team received an opportunity to table at the University of Texas at El Paso during a student conference on April 7-8 and was able to distribute general information regarding the program to student participants and answer questions regarding LULAC and the All of Us Health Research Program.","","","","Some of the challenges LULAC experienced during this month was finalizing a location for our Mental Health Cafecito initially scheduled for May. However, Rima Matsumoto has been helpful in putting us in contact with CASA de Maryland as a potential partner and site location.","During the month of April, LULAC’s Health Programs Coordinator learned how to complete the CPGI Strategy Plan. When the Health Programs Coordinator was on boarded last year in June the CPGI Strategy Plan had already been completed, approved and ready to begin execution  activities Throughout LULAC’s conversations with Rima and throughout watching the workshops a message that resonated with us is that there needs to be multiple touch points to increasing participant recruitment and participation in the program. LULAC made it a priority to host multiple events within a market to increase visibility and awareness.","LULAC had meetings with the All of Us team throughout the month of April to discuss the upcoming cafecito in May, social media communication updates and requests, and the CPGI Strategy Plan. Earlier this month LULAC met with Rima to discuss the CPGI Strategy Plan and get feedback on the plan. We also participated in the Chicago, NY and DMV market calls. LULAC received great feedback regarding the plan for the next cycle and began drafting responses to the questions raised by the review committee. Additionally, during our weekly check-in call Samantha Santoro shared communication updates regarding new toolkits uploaded to the asset portal. LULAC has incorporated social media posts regarding the researcher workbench into our communications plan. Additionally, we requested support from Samantha in drafting talking points and creating social media graphics for the Mental Health Awareness Month Cafecito that will take place in June, 2022 in the DMV. There will be two sessions for this cafecito event– one will be in Spanish and the other in English.

The challenge was addressed by continually emailing and calling for the information.  Another challenge is balancing All of Us demands during the workday when you are working and have back-to-back meetings.  The only way to address this challenge is to plead to the program that not all of the  All of Us meetings are during the volunteers' workday.","This is not a new lesson learned, but worth mentioning again, Marketing is Key!!!!","This month we worked on the strategy document and met with each of the 10 groups to get their feedback on what moving forward would look like for them..

We also held several calls preparing for our May 18th event titled “Avoid Suffering in Silence” which focused on mental health in the miliary.  We participated in the discussions around Rooted in Research as well as solicited potential sponsors for the program stops. We attended the Market Calls and gave input on different discussions being held. We worked with the core team on ordering needed items for the Atlanta stop as well as met with the local operations team to do a walkthrough of the venue selected for the Atlanta location event. Met with our team to discuss the 5-year plan along with giving input as to what our team would like to see. Held internal meetings with our leadership to discuss event ideas as we prepare for a mental health discussion with our Military and Veterans Commission. Held meetings with partner organizations to create a potential outreach program for the upcoming Summer Months. Also made several social media post in partnership with the other orgs on different posting strategies. Also presented information at the Southeastern Province Council and the other 11 Provinces as well. The presentations were mostly in person except for 2 that were virtual. Worked the events in Atlanta for Rooted in Resilience at Clark Atlanta University on April 22nd and the Community engagement event on April 23rd in East Point Commons. Aided in set up and break down along with soliciting vendors and artists for the overall event. Also assisted with the logistics of all events that were associated with the weekend and tour overall.","","","","The challenges that were presented were getting things done logistically with time and personnel. On Friday, April 22 due to timing and individual responsibilities we were at a shortage of manpower. Made a call to campus fraternity brothers and gained assistance for labor that was needed at the event. Assistance with putting things up along with loading and unloading.","Marketing is extremely important with conducting events both virtually and in person. We have to make sure this is done efficiently and effectively. We can’t just leave this piece to Social Media as we have to establish a presence locally in the area to make sure the word is getting out about the events being done. We also have to think outside the box by potentially even transporting those that may not have the means to physically be present to get the word out.","We attended all weekly meetings as well as the Local Atlanta NIH Meeting. We held briefing sessions to discuss our upcoming events as well as worked with our Social Media team to circulate All of Us information. We met with potential sponsors for the upcoming tour along with discussing potential ideas that may help with the Rooted in Resilience tour itself. Sent out various communication to our internal membership as well as our monthly newsletter on Health-related issues focusing as well on the program and the importance of clinical studies. Also encouraged our individual members to start to consider more people facing events by following the CDC guideline locally. Assisted with the Rooted and Resilience core planning by doing a site visit in Atlanta and walking the location. Ordered necessary needed items like the tent, tables, and chairs from one of the local vendors. Received assets from previous locations to store for the event along with assisting with the transport of the items to the events. Worked the Rooted in Resilience events on Friday and Saturday as well as met with individual vendors for the on-site community event. Assisted with the on-site logistics along with the setup and breakdown process. Communicated with the vendors for transport of items like staging, tents, port potties, etc as well as pick up of those items after the event ended.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

This was a collaborative event with our Health and Wellness and Military Veteran Affairs Commission along with the United States Veteran Affairs. This was streamed via Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. We also worked on run-throughs along with assisting with creating the run of the show and engaging the partners with questions prior to the event. Assisted with the various tasks associated with the completion of our Rooted in Resilience Tour with the items left from the event along with coordinated pickup and drop off.

We were able to do a run-through as well as get them to log on earlier prior to the event to manage any troubleshooting issues to assure things would run smoothly","Marketing is always key to getting the information out. We also recognized that the information especially on Mental Health is vital. During our event, we had a participant mention several times he was dealing with depression and was having suicidal thoughts. We reached out to him personally and had one of the panelists, who is a mental health professional call him directly. As a result, the young man mentioned he would seek assistance.","We attended all weekly meetings as well as the Local Atlanta NIH Meeting. We held briefing sessions to discuss our upcoming events as well as worked with our Social Media team to circulate All of Us information. We met with our panel for our Mental Health event to highlight Mental Health Awareness month. We conducted an overview of the All of Us Research Program along with offering the Pre and Post Test survey for our viewers to complete. We attempted to engage the Minneapolis HPO to participate in a Heart Health Event that was held in Minneapolis, MN but was not successful. We are always brainstorming different innovative ideas to push the envelope with the All of Us Research Program. Shared not only via Social Media but our internal membership database information regarding the All of Us Research Program and how to get involved.

As previously discussed, we know that the focus is on research and retention. As such our idea to keep our table talk format will allow us some flexibility in engaging researchers and physicians that work with HPOs. We found that our format has been very successful as a virtual event, however, we are planning one hybrid event. The event will be broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube. We have identified several speakers for the upcoming events; we have had preliminary discussions with a large NPHC Council that is located in one of the market cities. We assisted with and/or participated in Sigma Gamma Rho's recent event.","","","","The collective BGLC organizations have each expressed concerns about the current expected delivery of the All of Us message during events. Several strategies are being reviewed to ensure that we honor the expectations of the program while creating strategies to keep our constituents engaged, with the presentation. Some of our ideas include making the NIH information more engaging so that the All of Us message flows through our activations seamlessly and connects with our participants. For example, we would incorporate the presentation about All of Us in a way that makes for a smoother transition with our content.","As a result of participating in the CPGI Spring Engagement reviewing the CPGI Day Resources and Evaluation email, we gained greater insight into the trajectory of the All of Us program since Phase I. The growth and reach of the program are a direct result of all of the partnerships and the creative ideas for activations by the partners on all levels. We recognize that this program is ever-evolving and that our participation requires us to continue to evolve with the needs of the program. BGLC as a collective did a really good job of engaging our communities and enhancing awareness, but our work now will need to have a greater focus on research and retention. It is important to note that in Phase VI and Phase VII that we had begun moving in those directions with the development of the Rooted in Research and the Minority Student Research Symposium.","This month we participated in all BGLC Meetings. We participated in our weekly planning meetings for NPHC. We participated in and supported events hosted by other BGLC organizations. We worked on our strategy document for phase VIII. We registered for and participated in the CPGI Spring Engagement. Although we could not stay for the entire meeting due to scheduling conflicts, we did review the CPGI Day Resources and Evaluation email, which gave us time to do a deeper dive into the statement of work document and the CPGI presentation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

Our student Ambassadors are currently at the end of the academic year which is a very heavy exam and finals time for students and faculty alike. this has made it more difficult for the Ambassadors to set up meeting times with faculty members to discuss AoU and how to get involved as a researcher. It has also been more difficult for Ambassadors to get into the classroom to talk with students and young researchers due to exams and limited class time.","The greatest concern this month included communication with collaborators while planning for the National AHEC Organization All of Us Webinar.","The most glaring challenge that we faced this month was with communication with Greensboro AHEC while we were planning the National AHEC Organization All of Us Webinar. We felt like there was a significant disconnect between what was discussed and the final product that was presented.

To provide more equitable research and health care to those that live in the United States and those who have been historically underrepresented in care or mistreated in care and research. So we acknowledge that while there are bumps in the road for us as organizations we will continue to push forward for all voices to be heard.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

With growing advances in Public Health Data Science, the All of Us Program enters at a time where health information is accelerating at a rapid rate. Big data, computing systems, and predictive analytics all utilize current health information and available profiles. Through the All of Us Program, the researcher consortium cultivates healthcare analytics that is heterogenous and reflective of our communities. We hope to develop this op-ed and remark on our impact on healthcare solutions to come. 

In addition to the op-ed, the students within the Public Health Society will be submitting an abstract. This abstract recaps their work in relation to the All of Us Program and the initiatives they have led on campus. We are proud of their work and we hope that this submission is recognized. We have also successfully met with new leadership and begun the transition process as the current student leaders are graduating. We hope to further connect with them via an upcoming picnic!
 
 We are also developing our scope of work for the upcoming months. We are currently strategizing new opportunities to re-engage the community around us and initiate recruitment efforts with the help of  Henry Ford Health.","","There were very few barriers to participation this month. With steadfast efforts through social media posts and planning following events to come, goals were maintained. April also was the month of Ramadan, a period of fasting for many of the community members here. Members of all 3 collaborators observed Ramadan and strategized to host food-related events after its conclusion. Our community members spent the month focused on Ramadan, thus post-Ramadan is a season of renewed energy and joy. We hope to utilize this morale well in the upcoming month.
 As varying organizations transition and begin to assess a return to in-person events, we are also testing our comfort levels. There is interest and hope to bring our community members together, especially as warmer weather allows ease of gathering outside. We would like to be respectful of community members, and further build community amongst Access and our collaborators within the Metro-Detroit area. As Covid-19 begins to wane, we hope to reach our community members where they are.","","The Public Health Society has transitioned to new leadership, as current leaders are graduating from the University of Michigan Dearborn. With new leadership comes establishing relationships that understand the significance of the All of Us Program and how to navigate common goals. Access hopes that the success and willingness to collaborate with the Public Health Society at the University of Michigan Dearborn will continue to further programmatic recruitment and engage the student community here in Metro Detroit.","Lessons learned include mindfulness when it comes to transitioning to the end of the pandemic. There is great enthusiasm to meet and engage with our fellow collaborators. Just as we practiced respectful social distancing throughout the entirety of the pandemic, we will continue to meet and host tabling events, community pop-ups, and other outreach plans respectfully. Access remains prepared to lead in-person initiatives, with intentions to only benefit community health.","Network Ninja 2.0 Training

We also began promoting our May Self Care Mental Health - All of Us webinar that will be coming up in May.
●	Our Atlanta team assisted with the Rooted in Resilience Tour this month, which helped to gain greater visibility in that market, as well as to strengthen community partnerships which we hope will lead to future events. Each tour stop includes three components: education with an HBCU, community, and faith partners. Details about the three events are available at www.rootedinresilience.com. The flyer for this month’s event is also attached.

●	Sigma Gamma Rho conducted and participated in our candid conversation about self-care, best mental health practices, and the significance of medical research in minority communities. The conversation was with qualified mental health professionals right within the membership Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. and open to the public. With over 400 webinar participants and many relevant questions and conversations, it is well believed that SGRHO successfully shared the message and awareness about “ precision medicine” and the All of Us Research program.

We had a meeting with our engagement counselor to start with our strategic planning for the next funding cycle. As part of our in-person activities, on April 21, we did a bingo game with a focus on research, including the All of Us Research program, and nutrition at Casa Iris Housing Facility. We had over 20 participants who engaged in an interactive and educative session where they had the opportunity to learn about different health topics, tips to achieving good nutrition and physical health, and a recap in health research terminology and the importance of Hispanic/Latinos participating in health research and the All of Us Research program. Also, we are still finalizing logistics for the upcoming two webinars we are co-hosting with the DEC regarding perspectives from health researchers in advancing health equity in diverse communities scheduled for May 26 and June 23. We continue to be active on our social media platforms to educate and create awareness about the program and the importance of Hispanic/Latinos participating in health research.","","Due to the ongoing pandemic, we are conducting most of our events in a virtual setting. When we do conduct in-person events (e.g., bingo game) we make it a contactless experience. Meanwhile, we have been active on social media and doing virtual activities to promote the program and enrollment.","","We experienced no challenges in this reporting period.

The title of her presentation was ""An Introduction to XULA HEALS in the CommUNITY."" The presentation introduced faculty to the AoURP and the AoU Workbench and Research Hub. 
Dr. Lemieux & Nicole met with the Center for Minority Health & Health Disparitie's Community Advisor Board LA-SEAL to introduce the All of Us Research Program and to put out ""feelers"" to see if they would be interested in a collaboration to promote community engagement and enrollment. This initial meeting was promising and we are looking forward to developing an organic relationship with the CAB. We also meet with faculty across multiple disciplines to discuss board curriculum integration and researcher tooling in regards to the AoURP and Workbench/Data Browser. The response was overwhelming positive and faculty are working with their respective departments to secure approval to participate.","","CAB members expressed  possible concerns about community members having access to transportation and limitations with smart devices for enrollment.","During our discussion with the LA-CEAL CAB, board members were receptive to our invitation to have a ""live"" experience of their own to share with community members who may consider engaging and possibly enrolling in the AoURP as a way to facilitate trust in the enrollment process. The concern expressed was one of being authentic about engaging the community without appearing out of touch with the community.","We had minimal challenges this month. This time of the year is most stressful because as we are building out our SOW for the next funding cycle, we have internal routing and approvals that we have to comply with all while balancing the timing of the release of the funds  for the next program cycle.","No lesson to report this month.","4/1/22 Dr. Lemieux & Nicole weekly AoU meeting to discuss building out current programming.
