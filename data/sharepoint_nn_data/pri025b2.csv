Moving forward with communication with program leadership thanks to strong help from our engagement counselor.","","We continue to hear from our researchers that they are having issues with the workbench. We scheduled a time to meet with people from the DRC to go over issues. 

We also faced pretty low registration numbers for the faith event, despite our usual promotion. Turnaround time on shareables was tough, and sharing the Google doc wasn’t useful for our comms team, because they couldn’t access the images linked from the asset portal. We did eventually get those to them, but it would be easier to have all the tools in one zip drive or folder for simple access.","Continued conversation with our engagement counselor will help us overcome some of the obstacles","Attended CPGI and DMV market calls.

Ciauna hosted two activities, both of which were remote presentations via Zoom for the Denver Asian American Pacific Islander Commission and the Asian Pacific Development Center (APDC) Behavioral Health Clinic. Miryam, Mikaela, and Deandra tabled at the North Colorado Medical Center for Banner Health. Annabelle tabled at the University Commons at the University of Denver. Our student ambassadors alone educated 260 individuals about the All of Us Research Program in the last five months. Additionally, we tabled at the National Forum of Nursing Workforce Centers in Las Vegas, NV, educating 36 amount of people about All of Us. Lastly, we hosted a webinar with Banner Health and shared information with participants regarding the foundations of the program as well as what it is like to enroll. It has been a very busy but incredibly rewarding last month of our cycle!","","We are concerned about continued student engagement and have other students interested in becoming ambassadors for the All of Us Research Program. We find this to be a barrier to participation and would love to pass along our Student Ambassador Program to another community partner to ensure young professionals and students are engaged and promoting this valuable program. Abigail plans to share the Student Ambassador Program packet with Julia before her last day at THEARI so that another community partner could potentially use it in the future.","N/A","Challenges experienced by our organization included low participation and engagement with the co-hosted webinar with Banner Health. We did not begin marketing soon enough (3 weeks in advance) and did not consider other calendar factors (Banner Health had a very large webinar the week prior).","Lessons learned from this is that we need to start marketing much sooner, compare calendars in closer detail, and also have a theme to our webinar experience to draw more people. We also recognize Zoom fatigue and need to consider the time of year as well as summer is a challenging season for engagement.","This month's activities included check-ins with each of our student ambassadors, attendance at the Denver Market meeting, we hosted our last internal THEARI team meeting, met with Banner Health to prepare for our co-hosted webinar, four student ambassador activities including two tabling activities and two remote presentations, tabling at the National Forum of Nursing Workforce Centers Conference in Las Vegas, hosted a Zoom celebration for our student ambassadors, co-hosted a webinar with Banner Health, bi-monthly check-ins with Lin, and attended my 1:1 check-in with Julia.","The best resonating messages this month come from our Student Ambassador Program (SAP) survey. These are direct quotes but responses were anonymous.

""Presenting and pitching the program when we tabled for events certainly allowed me to practice my presentation skills. It challenged me to talk about research in a concise yet comprehensive way. It is definitely a valuable skill that I will continue to hone in future opportunities.""

""Becoming a student ambassador was a wonderful and valuable opportunity! It aligned with my interests in health equity. I also couldn't have asked for better support from THEARI and Abigail.""

""I think tabling at the hospital was a great activity because that is where we saw the most interest in the program and interacted with the most amount of people. It was a great opportunity to have people learn about the program and then go directly upstairs to enroll or turn in info cards.""

- Communications/social media: Monthly social media posts on AAPA/PA Foundation channels - 6/2, 6/9, 6/14. Incorporated messaging related to Pride Month, Men's Health Week; used social media toolkits provided on Engagement Hub. Communications team developed final quarterly communications article related to All of Us; topic: ""Top 10 reasons PAs should consider genetics in their practice."" Shared draft with communications counselor for review/editing. Published on News Central section of AAPA website on 6/28.
- CME sessions (AoU conference session, research session, and Genetics & Genomics CME bundle): Enduring sessions on AAPA Learning Central; continuing to collect/compile participation metrics on a monthly basis. 
- Website landing pages: Continuing to collect monthly metrics.
- Follow-up metric from AAPA 2022 Conference - Almost 1 in 5 participants in a post-conference survey reported they noticed NIH All of Us Research Program as a sponsor at AAPA 2022.

In addition to closing out 2021-22 activities, we focused on preparing for the 2022-23 program cycle. We held several internal meetings (see governance activities below) related to developing our SOW activities and budget. We have drafted our SOW activities and budget and are now working on inputting them into the approved SOW/budget templates (received 6/17).","","N/A","N/A","Challenges this month had to do with developing and refining our 2022-23 SOW activities in order to best reflect the needs, priorities, and incentives of our audience. Based on conversations with collaborating partners, we took action to revise our initial ideas and reshape them to better align with our partners' capacity/motivations and audience priorities/incentives.","We continue to see the importance of adapting and modifying plans as needed based on evolving conversations with our partners and insights on our audience and their needs/priorities. For example, in planning conversations with one partner, we learned that our initial plan to target PA faculty members for presentations/demos on the All of Us Research Hub would likely not be as effective or valuable as targeting PA programs and students. Based on this, we have adjusted our proposed strategy/activities to include an activity focused on this specific audience (virtual presentation series to PA programs).","Governance activities this month included our monthly internal check-in meeting and other planning conversations and coordination regarding SOW development for the 2022-23 cycle.

Meetings included: 
Planning meeting with PAEA for 2022-23 cycle - 6/10; 
Planning meeting with internal stakeholders for 2022-23 SOW - 6/14;  
Internal check-in meeting - 6/14; 
CPGI bimonthly webinar - 6/14; 
Meeting/check-in with Engagement Counselor to share SOW ideas - 6/22.

We also worked on our 2021-22 end-of-cycle report and submitted it electronically on 6/28.","Messages related to Pride Month and Men's Health Week resonated well with our audience.","N/A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

We also hosted a booth during the Let The Good TImes Roll Festival during the Juneteenth weekend where we brought visibility and awareness to the AoU program.  We were allowed on the main stage to talk about the AoU program twice and we walked through the crowd with QR codes and encouraged participation.

LULAC also met with NHCOA, NHMA, Mary’s Center and CASA to discuss the cafecito event and the health fair component to the event. LULAC shared an invitation and more information about this event at the DMV market call on June 21, 2022. 
On June 25th, LULAC held a successful event at CASA in Hyattsville, MD in collaboration with NHCOA, NHMA, Mary’s Center and CASA. All co-hosting organizations had a table with health related resources for the community. We also had an AoU table where all organizations volunteered along with Pyxis team members to engage and address questions about the program. We had giveaways and a tabletop display along with other program materials that were also displayed at the organization’s tables. At the AoU booth, there were 21 engagements. Mary’s Center brought their enrollment privacy booth to help facilitate enrollment to those community members interested in participating in the program, and successfully helped enroll 10 participants. NHCOA transported 10 older adults to the event to participate in the Spanish session of the mental health cafecito. Mary’s Center was also able to bring a behavioral provider specialist to speak to community members about the services they provide around mental health.","","","not enough mental health resources available in Spanish and for senior citizens.","Given all CPGI organizations are finalizing activities and reports for this cycle, and in addition, LULAC is in the middle of planning and coordinating our largest annual event scheduled for the end of July, which will also be our first one back in-person, we found ourselves in a crunch time for the June 25 event. It took time and good effort to bring together all co-hosting organizations, as well as the additional local organizations providing health tests and screenings. In hindsight, we could have done a better job with communications and more time to execute, but this experience has provided us with lessons learned for future collaborations in the DMV and other markets.","During the month of June, LULAC learned that for future collaborative events, we should have more meetings among co-hosting organizations leading up to the event so everyone is better informed of logistics and assignments, in order to avoid making last minute decisions. Although we understand that the last minute changes were due to unexpected illness with team members and vendors, as well as competing events on the same day by our organization where we had no previous knowledge. Also, to include additional time and efforts on promotion including canvassing in surrounding areas to increase community participation.","During the month of June, LULAC met with Rima and Samantha to finalize the logistics for the Mental Health Cafecito. Samantha helped put together a social media plan and talking points for the event. In addition, Rima was instrumental in building the connection with CASA de Maryland. She helped us acquire the space and build partnerships with NHCOA, NHMA and Mary’s Center. We also held prep call with NHCOA, NHMA, Mary’s Center and CASA de Maryland to discuss the cafecito event and the overall  health fair component to the event. LULAC also participated in the DMV market call and shared an invitation and more information about this event on June 21, 2022. 
On June 14th, LULAC attended the CPGI Biweekly Meeting and learned about the new markets and additional information  for cycle 4. Unfortunately, LULAC was unable to attend the NY Market call as we had a previously scheduled all staff planning meeting for  our upcoming National Convention. 
Lastly this month, Rima and the LULAC team have been discussing the execution plan for the 2022 LULAC National Convention that is taking place in San Juan, PR in late July.  We have discussed outreach and exhibiting and speaking opportunities.

This meeting arose from a Spring Engagement Meeting panel Dr. Bennet participated.  The DRC invited Dr. Bennett, via our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla, to give feedback on the lack of an option to stratify All of Us data for rural areas, as he spoke about in the panel. Dr. Bennett offered the idea of creating a rural variable, rather than using zip codes, for privacy reasons; he also discussed how beneficial it would be for community groups to be able to access the AoU data in summary form; it would give them more information about their communities. The summary (and deidentified) data could be used for funding opportunities, community needs assessments or more. The Program’s data could be used for improving community health beyond its use by data scientists.  Dr. Bennett will speak more with the DRC, along with his colleague Dr. Samuel Baxter of Clemson University to discuss institutions and their data user agreements. NRHA members learned about the Workbench and looked to establish a data user agreement for their university so they could access the data, they found one existed already, but they have never heard about. It seems like even the existence of the AoU data user agreement can be siloed among universities.","","NRHA appreciates the DRC’s invitation to Dr. Bennett to discuss barriers to both rural participation in the Program and the Workbench.  We look forward to continuing to discuss these barriers and potential solutions in Cycle 4.","This month being June, our sub-awardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, shared the Pride Month content that the Program provided. LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert shared this about the engagement with the content:  

“I wanted to note that we had more engagement on June’s posts than any other month.  However, not all of the engagement was positive.  The majority of the comments we received were anti-LGBTQ+ (since the posts were related to Pride Month).  None of them rose to the level of hate comments so I did not delete or respond to them.  They were generally along the lines of “being gay is a mental illness/sin” and similar comments.  Some comments were rebuttals to these comments.  I will still count all engagement regardless of the type in the reporting but just wanted to share for your information.” 

If the Program has any specific drafted responses that we should provide to our subawardees or if they would like to discuss the LRHA’s experience with Ms. Herbert, we are happy to help in anyway possible. Or perhaps in Cycle 4, NRHA can discuss potential responses with our communications team lead that we can share with our subawardees.","NRHA subawardees were slow to provide their social media metrics. While NRHA staffer Lea Mann has created submission forms for our subawardees to provider their social media data, NNRHA plans to continue enhancing our reporting system for our subawardees and partners in Cycle 4. 

NRHA’s sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association (LRHA) had an All of Us related post denied by Facebook when trying to post the content. Facebook provided the following explanation for its rejection of the post, “it doesn’t comply with our Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics policy.” The post content included a Pride Month video asset along with the caption, “Black gay men are the only population in which new HIV cases have been growing since 2001. The @AllofUsResearch Program aims to help reduce health disparities like this by making sure there is real representation in health research. When there is actual diversity, researchers can learn more about our differences. This #Pride2022, you can help too if you sign up and #JoinAllofUs at JoinAllofUs.org/Together.”  LRHA resolved to not post the content but did inform NRHA of the issue they ran into so we may make the Program aware of this hurdle.","NRHA continues to learn more about existing assets in the asset portal that can be used by our subawardees in numerous ways. It was great to be able to provide several flyers in both English and Spanish for the Arizona Rural Health Conference through the AzRHA’s exhibit space.  

Another lesson learned was that even though the Program, and NRHA, have been educating our stakeholders for years, there is still opportunity to reach those who have either not been informed or those who do not have complete information about the Program. We look forward to continuing, modifying, and expanding our engagement efforts in Cycle 4.","Between May 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings. Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us observances of Pride Month, Men’s Health Week, and World Sickle Cell Day social media toolkits through our platforms.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.  

Donating your data to the program is like donating to your community, the research gets closer to home, impacting health outcomes in your community. If not, those in power are making health decisions about you without you.","At the end of June, NRHA received an outline on an All of Us-centric Community Health Worker (CHW) Training by Janel Lowman, a certified community health worker trainer. NRHA contracted with Ms. Lowman earlier in the cycle to develop this outline, as NRHA believes that CHWs can be a key resource in engaging and educating rural populations about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has since reviewed and made comments on this outline and has also sent it to our engagement and communication counselors for their review and comment. NRHA has invited Janel Lowman to our weekly meeting with our counselors from Pyxis to discuss her work and what action we will be taking in Cycle 4 to move this project forward.  

Through the Engagement Incubator, NRHA staffer Laura Hudson connected with Daniel Moretti of Standford PrideNet. Daniel, Laura, and Lea met on June 1st and discussed several ways to collaborate especially in the new Target Market of California. In Cycle 4, we discussed PrideNet serving as a speaker on the podcast for the California State Rural Health Association to discuss AoU. We also discussed connecting their regional coordinators with our subawardees and other state rural health associations. There may also be interest in working together on either a virtual “fireside chat” or perhaps rural specific materials for their target population. NRHA is excited about this new collaboration in Cycle 4 made possible, in part, by the Program.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Rural Health Association (NRHA)","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

We hosted several virtual, drive-thru, and some in-person events with all of our partners across Dallas and Houston Texas and Louisiana with virtual events extending into many other States as well. 

In Dallas, Community Council hosted a series of events, We held our annual ""Dartfest"" in celebration of Older American's Month, focused on educating and empowering seniors to achieve better health and wellness by introducing them to the All of Us Research Program and other resources. 

In Houston, the Harris County Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection Aging and Disability Resource Center, collaborated with Venn Strategies and the Holy Trinity Missionary Baptist Church for a community health fair. Many agencies participated from across the Houston Metropolitan area sharing information, resources, and presentations. We presented on the of the All of Us Research Program with a question-and-answer period for anyone who had questions regarding the Program. We also included the impact of chronic disease as a topic area and ended the presentation with instructions on how to join the All of Us project. We encouraged each participant to share this information with their providers and handed out the All of Us masks to attendees.    

In New Orleans, the New Orleans Council on Aging continues to provide information regarding All of Us to Senior Centers as they continue to re-open and increase their population. We also collaborated  with additional partners, such as Xavier University and LSU, in order to advance education of the All of Us Research Program.

In Shreveport, the Caddo Council on Aging held some drive-thru wellness events. Participants were able to receive information about resources and services offered in Caddo Parish. Individuals were also be able to receive COVID vaccines and information about the All of Us Research Program.

In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Agency on Aging hosted some outreach events, as well as continue to deliver some ""All of Us"" material to seniors in East Feliciana Parish.","","","","As the pandemic winds down, our main challenge now, and across all our partners, is the planning of more in-person events. In the meantime, we continue to host virtual events promoting the All of Us Research Program.","This month, we focused on working to inform partners about the All of Us project. Our key factor is marketing and networking strategies to grab the attention of health workers, and community liaisons. Our goal is to empower diverse communities and workers. This month we also focused on Social Media outlets, such as Facebook Live.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community Council","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

We have confirmed our speakers for the Table Talk series as well as identified a partner that will provide information on how to sign up as well as a more focused presentation tying the research to our subject matter. We have expanded our marketing to focus on additional ways to market our series in addition to changing our primary delivery method so that we are able to gauge attendance of our events through pre-registration. This effort will allow us to change when we deliver the pre-test i.e., during the event registration. Please note that we plan to deliver the event via Facebook live and upload it to YouTube on the NPHCTV channel.","","","","As we continue to reflect on the information, we have provided during our weekly BGLC meetings, we have made strides in developing the ideas we mentioned in the previous summary report. All messaging that we plan to use will be submitted for approval to ensure that we are staying on brand and that our messaging connects that audience not only with the subject matter of the event but how to connect with the All of Us.","In the presentations we received, some of our team learned in great depth how to understand and accurately report social media metrics. While our social media coordinator usually handles all things social media, we were moved to do a deeper dive in looking at our previous events performance on social media as we prepared the Comprehensive Phase VII report. We were able to look at several demographics that helped us understand the diversity of our audience. We also confirmed that these events continue to be viewed, which confirmed for us that the concepts we provided are indeed pertinent and relevant to our desired audience.","This month we participated in all BGLC Meetings. We participated in our weekly planning meetings for NPHC. We participated in and supported events hosted by other BGLC organizations. We worked on details related to the Scope of Work for phase VIII.

On June 8th, 2022, NHMA held a provider-focused roundtable in our new office. NHMA received 13 registrants and 2 people who showed up.  Additionally, NHMA collaborated with LULAC, Mary's Center, and NHCOA to participate in a health fair in-person at CASA in Maryland. The event featured tabling, giveaways, and cafecitos in English and Spanish. NHMA sent three representatives to support the event and set up a table to give out NHMA branded bags, HIV materials, and All of Us incentives that were still remaining after our conference in March. Virtually, NHMA continued to post on social media and launched the Facebook Ad Takeover campaign with the help of our EC and the Clyde Group. NHMA also continued active participation on partner calls, target market calls, meetings with our EC and the CPGI webinar. NHMA completed the final month of All of Us content inclusion within our monthly newsletter.

In preparation for our new project year, NHMA has been soliciting and creating a list of interested physicians and NHMA chapters to leverage for inclusion in our efforts.","","","","NHMA did not experience any challenges this month.","Despite a disappointing turnout for our provider roundtable on June 8th, NHMA, our EC, and Jakara Eason, along with other Pyxis staff, had a very productive discussion with George Zangaro and Colleen Leners from AACN. NHMA learned that the program is continuing to encourage partners to start enrolling participants and researchers. Dr. Leners had great experiences and insights from working with HPO's in the past and it was helpful to learn more about how that process looks on the ground in certain regions, and how partnerships are established. It helped to paint a better picture of the CPGI role and the role of the HPO's and how the work flow is typically handled. Dr. Leners emphasized the importance of following up with potential participants immediately after the event, the advantages of Ipads at events, and the crucial role that QR codes played at in-person events.","This month, NHMA met Rima Matsumoto on June 2nd, where she informed us about the LULAC in-person health fair opportunity, which we were extremely excited to participate in. On June 9th, NHMA met with the other partners who agreed to participate in the LULAC health fair at CASA. On June 13th, NHMA participated in the CPGI webinar where we learned about enrollment updates and the MSRS in March/April. The following day, NHMA attended the New York Target Market Call. On June 15th. NHMA met with our EC briefly for a check-in and to introduce our EC to our new Director of Programs, Yvonne Malloy, MPP.

Dr. Cunningham recorded and provided a video presentation entitled ""My “Why”: Genomics Journey"" where he discussed his personal motivations as a member of a historically underrepresented minority group (African-American) for participating in genomic research studies such as the NIH All of Us Program. He also shared information with participants on the background of genomics research and the importance of recruiting more diverse participants for genomic research studies in order to make the resulting data more relevant to all US citizens. In addition to providing the recording for this meeting, Dr. Cunningham attended the virtual meeting online and participated in several of the breakout room sessions throughout. 


B) On behalf of the Faith Based Genetic Research Institute, Dr. Cunningham provided content for an interview for Diversity In Action Magazine. Dr. Cunningham responded to a variety of interview questions about the importance of recruiting diverse participants for genomic research studies and highlighted specific strategies for engaging African-American communities in churches and other public gatherings. Dr. Cunningham specifically highlighted the importance of minority individuals participating in the NIH All of Us program, with the hope of inspiring those in their readership to participate.

The fact that the program is managed by the government is a barrier to participation","Lack of trust","The challenge for this month was being told that we would no longer have the same EC we have worked with since the beginning, 5 years.  We were also told that we would no longer have the newest EC who began working with us last June.  I want to stress the word told, there were no conversations prior to being told which leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you are told that you are a partner.  Then we find out that one of the new ECs is not Greek.  That is a problem for BGLC because this person will not understand what it is like to be a Black Greek, meaning they would not know how to advocate for us.    The challenge is being addressed, we will see where we land.","I learned that sometimes no matter how hard you work and the sacrifices you make, sometimes it is still overlooked.","This month has been filled with preparing for the SOW and the end-of-year report, and the June report,  This is a great deal of work when you are working with 9 organizations.

Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity BGLC Assistant Coordinator Jarrod Benjamin participated as a Collaboration Partner in the New Orleans Regional Bank Chamber of Commerce Men's Health Week Facebook Live Event on Wednesday, June 15, 2022. The host was the New Orleans Regional Black Chamber of Commerce and the Southern University of New Orleans as well as the LSU Health Center (enrollment partner) that served on the initiative.  

During the month of June 2022, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity coordinators worked to confirm the dates for activities in the cities designated for the phase of the All of Us research project.  The scheduled activities in Houston TX (on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University) will be in the month of October 2022. The scheduled activities in Itta Bena MS (on the campus of Mississippi Valley State University) will be in the month of October 2022.  

Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity coordinators worked to confirm the dates for activities that will provide community outreach and retention services for the Milwaukee WI area.  That activity will be a collaboration with Holy Redeemer Church of God in Christ, a minority faith-based organization.  The scheduled activities will be January 18 – 19, 2023.

Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity also changed its promotional pattern as an All of Us partner.  The information normally included in the social media platforms will now be placed in our weekly Programs Newsletter.  The newsletter has a reach of 30,000.","","•	Trust in healthcare providers

Along with our engagement counselor and the communications team, we are keeping track of the timeline related to the activities for this funding cycle.

When we do conduct in-person events (e.g., bingo games and mini health fairs) we make it a contactless experience. Meanwhile, we have been active on social media and doing virtual activities to promote the program and enrollment.","","We experienced no challenges in this reporting period. We continue to meet weekly with our CPGI engagement counselor to troubleshoot any issues as they arise.","During this month, we engaged in weekly meetings with our engagement counselor, Rima Matsumoto, to ensure partnerships and activities are aligned with program goals. We continue to meet with our engagement counselor to discuss strategic planning for the next funding cycle.  Also, we had a planning call with the communications team and engagement counselor to discuss promotional materials for the webinar scheduled on June 23. As part of our virtual activities,  we co-hosted the “Perspectives from Health Researchers in Advancing Health Equity in Diverse Communities: Part 2” webinar along with the Diverse Elders Coalition (DEC). Also, we collaborated with organizations from the DMV area to conduct an in person health fair titled as “United for our Health” in Hyattsville, Maryland on June 25.  During this health fair, NHCOA served as a moderator for the Cafecito con LULAC and we incorporated 10 older adults into this activity. During the Cafecito, seniors were able to learn more about mental health among Hispanics/Latinos, know more about mental health resources available to the community, and about the All of Us Research program and how the program is helping researchers understand why people get sick or stay healthy. We continue to be active on our social media platforms to educate and create awareness about the program and the importance of Hispanic/Latinos participating in health research.","This month, we participated in weekly meetings with our engagement counselor to continue working on our activities for this new funding cycle.
