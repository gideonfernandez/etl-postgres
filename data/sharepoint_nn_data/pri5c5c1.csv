We scheduled a time to meet with people from the DRC to go over issues. 

We also faced pretty low registration numbers for the faith event, despite our usual promotion. Turnaround time on shareables was tough, and sharing the Google doc wasn’t useful for our comms team, because they couldn’t access the images linked from the asset portal. We did eventually get those to them, but it would be easier to have all the tools in one zip drive or folder for simple access.","Continued conversation with our engagement counselor will help us overcome some of the obstacles","Attended CPGI and DMV market calls.

- Communications/social media: Monthly social media posts on AAPA/PA Foundation channels - 6/2, 6/9, 6/14. Incorporated messaging related to Pride Month, Men's Health Week; used social media toolkits provided on Engagement Hub. Communications team developed final quarterly communications article related to All of Us; topic: ""Top 10 reasons PAs should consider genetics in their practice."" Shared draft with communications counselor for review/editing. Published on News Central section of AAPA website on DATE.
- CME sessions (AoU conference session, research session, and Genetics & Genomics CME bundle): Enduring sessions on AAPA Learning Central; continuing to collect/compile participation metrics on a monthly basis. 
- Website landing pages: Continuing to collect monthly metrics.

In addition to closing out 2021-22 activities, we focused on preparing for the 2022-23 program cycle. We held several internal meetings (see governance activities below) related to developing our SOW activities and budget. We have drafted our SOW activities and budget and are now working on inputting them into the approved SOW/budget templates (received 6/17).","","N/A","N/A","Challenges this month had to do with developing and refining our 2022-23 SOW activities in order to best reflect the needs, priorities, and incentives of our audience. Based on conversations with collaborating partners, we took action to revise our initial ideas and reshape them to better align with our partners' capacity/motivations and audience priorities/incentives.","We continue to see the importance of adapting and modifying plans as needed based on evolving conversations with our partners and insights on our audience and their needs/priorities. For example, in planning conversations with one partner, we learned that our initial plan to target PA faculty members for presentations/demos on the All of Us Research Hub would likely not be as effective or valuable as targeting PA programs and students. Based on this, we have adjusted our proposed strategy/activities to include an activity focused on this specific audience (virtual presentation series to PA programs).","Governance activities this month included our monthly internal check-in meeting and other planning conversations and coordination regarding SOW development for the 2022-23 cycle.

Meetings included: 
Planning meeting with PAEA for 2022-23 cycle - 6/10; 
Internal planning meeting for 2022-23 SOW - 6/14;  
Internal check-in meeting - 6/14; 
CPGI bimonthly webinar - 6/14.

We also worked on our 2021-22 end-of-cycle report for submission by July 15.","Messages related to Pride Month and Men's Health Week resonated well with our audience.","N/A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

We challenged them to be creative to make science fun and I know we were successful by the videos posted.  We also hosted a booth during the Let The Good TImes Roll Festival during the Juneteenth weekend where we brought visibility and awareness to the AoU program.  We were allowed on the main stage to talk about the AoU program twice and we walked through the crowd with QR codes and encouraged participation.  The Mayor for the City of Shreveport was there, we took pictures, as well as, made sure he was signed up for the program as well.  We believe the turn out and awareness was very beneficial to our efforts.","","No barriers identified","Some of our participants expressed concerns regarding the number of steps it takes to sign up on the website.  While we did a good job of steering them there, getting them through the steps is another challenge","The only challenges faced are the number of steps required to actually completely get enrolled in the program.  While we were successful to pushing individuals to the site, it will be a challenge to get them to finish the process after they have left the festival.","We should do this again.  It was very successful and I need more volunteers to work the large crowd.","In the month of June, we have met internally with our team to begin discussing the 4th cycle program of work.  We attended the bi-weekly CPGI webinar as well as met regularly with our engagement counselor. The monthly Louisiana Engagement Networking meeting has been cancelled for this month which allows me to complete our work a little early.  All recaps for activities have been completed for the month of June and we have begun to work on our end of cycle wrap up report due in July.  This cycle has been very rewarding for us as our students that we engaged wrote various messages thanking us for providing information on biomedical research and precision medicine career pathways.  We have truly begun to open their eyes to the possibilities of professions in the industry.","The messaging this month changed because we are focusing more on participant recruitment.  The resonating message was we need to know more about what AoU is doing.","Just Thank You for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pearls of Humanity Foundation","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

2.	Finding the statics about visits to the Landing page.
3.	Security of information concerns by individuals.
4.	Getting results from the HPOs.  They should be required to send any metrics to partners by a certain date.  It would make reporting more seamless for the program.
5.	4.  A rise in COVID cases has impacted face to face engagements.","1.	 Collaboration for future events are hard to plan with CPGI partners.
2.     Many people are excited about the program.  One lady stated that she has already enrolled in the program after hearing our presentation.

We hosted several virtual, drive-thru, and some in-person events with all of our partners across Dallas and Houston Texas and Louisiana with virtual events extending into many other States as well. 

In Dallas, Community Council hosted a series of events, We held our annual ""Dartfest"" in celebration of Older American's Month, focused on educating and empowering seniors to achieve better health and wellness by introducing them to the All of Us Research Program and other resources. 

In Houston, the Harris County Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection Aging and Disability Resource Center, collaborated with Venn Strategies and the Holy Trinity Missionary Baptist Church for a community health fair. Many agencies participated from across the Houston Metropolitan area sharing information, resources, and presentations. We presented on the of the All of Us Research Program with a question-and-answer period for anyone who had questions regarding the Program. We also included the impact of chronic disease as a topic area and ended the presentation with instructions on how to join the All of Us project. We encouraged each participant to share this information with their providers and handed out the All of Us masks to attendees.    

In New Orleans, the New Orleans Council on Aging continues to provide information regarding All of Us to Senior Centers as they continue to re-open and increase their population. We also collaborated  with additional partners, such as Xavier University and LSU, in order to advance education of the All of Us Research Program.

In Shreveport, the Caddo Council on Aging held some drive-thru wellness events. Participants were able to receive information about resources and services offered in Caddo Parish. Individuals were also be able to receive COVID vaccines and information about the All of Us Research Program.

In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Agency on Aging hosted some outreach events, as well as continue to deliver some ""All of Us"" material to seniors in East Feliciana Parish.","","","","As the pandemic winds down, our main challenge now, and across all our partners, is the planning of more in-person events. In the meantime, we continue to host virtual events promoting the All of Us Research Program.","This month, we focused on working to inform partners about the All of Us project. Our key factor is marketing and networking strategies to grab the attention of health workers, and community liaisons. Our goal is to empower diverse communities and workers. This month we also focused on Social Media outlets, such as Facebook Live.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Community Council","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","No"," "

We have expanded our marketing to focus on additional ways to market our series in addition to changing our primary delivery method so that we are able to gauge attendance of our events through pre-registration. This effort will allow us to change when we deliver the pre-test i.e., during the event registration.

While our social media coordinator usually handles all things social media, we were moved to do a deeper dive in looking at our previous events performance on social media as we prepared the Comprehensive Phase VII report. We were able to look at several demographics that helped us understand the diversity of our audience. We also confirmed that these events continue to be viewed, which confirmed for us that the concepts we provided are indeed pertinent and relevant to our desired audience.","This month we participated in all BGLC Meetings.

Dr. Cunningham recorded and provided a video presentation entitled ""My “Why”: Genomics Journey"" where he discussed his personal motivations as a member of a historically underrepresented minority group (African-American) for participating in genomic research studies such as the NIH All of Us Program. He also shared information with participants on the background of genomics research and the importance of recruiting more diverse participants for genomic research studies in order to make the resulting data more relevant to all US citizens. In addition to providing the recording for this meeting, Dr. Cunningham attended the virtual meeting online and participated in several of the breakout room sessions throughout. 


B) On behalf of the Faith Based Genetic Research Institute, Dr. Cunningham provided content for an interview for Diversity In Action Magazine. Dr. Cunningham responded to a variety of interview questions about the importance of recruiting diverse participants for genomic research studies and highlighted specific strategies for engaging African-American communities in churches and other public gatherings. Dr. Cunningham specifically highlighted the importance of minority individuals participating in the NIH All of Us program, with the hope of inspiring those in their readership to participate.

The fact that the program is managed by the government is a barrier to participation","Lack of trust","The challenge for this month was being told that we would no longer have the same EC we have worked with since the beginning, 5 years.  We were also told that we would no longer have the newest EC who began working with us last June.  I want to stress the word told, there were no conversations prior to being told which leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you are told that you are a partner.  Then we find out that one of the new ECs is not Greek.  That is a problem for BGLC because this person will not understand what it is like to be a Black Greek, meaning they would not know how to advocate for us.    The challenge is being addressed, we will see where we land.","I learned that sometimes no matter how hard you work and the sacrifices you make, sometimes it is still overlooked.","This month has been filled with preparing for the SOW and the end-of-year report, and the June report,  This is a great deal of work when you are working with 9 organizations.
