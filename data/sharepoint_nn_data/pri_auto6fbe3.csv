The center continues to develop a better understanding of how AHECs can support the All of Us program through our experience and the opportunities provided by Pyxis to collaborate with AHEC/THEARI and the WA Ecosystem.","","The main challenge is capacity at this time.  However, the AHEC is actively working to address this issue.","Center capacity has been a challenge this year.  It was expected that center staff would need to be flexible to delivery of media work on virtual and in-person events.  However, the challenges of staffing and hiring during the pandemic were new with many organizations in the AHEC network impacted by the great resignation.  This had internal implications, but also impacted AHEC external partners and contacts. 

The AHEC hired two more part-time hourly staff in March and spent time onboarding and training during the month of April.  This was challenging to administer during our planned travel months for the All of Us Program, but also a positive for the center. Lesly Pumay was added to the All of Us program grant work at the center to support social media work. She is graduating this year with a BFA in Design from Cornish College of Arts.  The AHECWW working diligently to launch a social media campaign as a part of our All of Us grant before the close of the fiscal year. 

The center also interviewed candidates and hired one new full-time position to start in May. These efforts will significantly improve center capacity across grant work. The AHECWW continues to push forward identifying strategies to maintain and deliver grant tasks to the best of staff ability and capacity, while addressing any deficiencies","During the Western Forum, Cori Garcia Hansen became ill with an upper respiratory infection.  She was then not allowed to participate in the in-person conference.  However, the AHECWW center sent two staff, so Carlos Morales, was able to cover the event activities.  The AHECWW also had the support of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health.  Overall, the task was delivered successfully.   

As the AHECWW looks forward to the opportunity to continue participation with the All of Us Program, the center has reflected on its niche and role in the work in the WA Ecosystem.  The education and awareness piece seems complimentary to the work to build support among health professionals working in underserved communities.  Ultimately, this will help with recruitment and retention.  We also continue to provide information about the research work bench to the health professions student and professional audience. The AHEC needs to learn more about how to best evaluate and survey participants in programming to serve the other collaborative efforts in the region and goals of the program.  As the development of the WA Ecosystem group is new, the center is optimistic about the opportunities to collaborate and form a streamlined approach with tangible outcomes in support of regional partners.","With the ongoing challenges during the pandemic, the experience with event coverage demonstrated the importance of back-up plans and staffing when unforeseen factors like illness impact the work.","The AHECWW participated in the CPGI Engagement Counseling meeting and the National AHEC Organization All of Us Program presentation. These meetings were very helpful in event prep and with  completing the AHECWW  New Cycle Planning Packet.  The AHECWW did not attend the AHEC/THEARI meeting, as this was during the Western Forum. This meeting time was used for the other AHECs to practice for their collaborative presentation on the student ambassador program, which the AHECWW currently does not provide.","Thus far, the AHECWW is finding that participant engagement best-resonating messages are about opportunities to engage in research.  This makes sense, as AHECs primarily work with students and health professionals who are passionate about service to underserved communities and improving healthcare for these populations.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We hosted several virtual, drive-thru, and some in-person events with all of our partners across Dallas and Houston Texas and Louisiana with virtual events extending into many other States as well. 

In Dallas, Community Council hosted a series of events, we held the last segment of our ""Healthy Cooking"" virtual show, as well as two in-person events “Family Fit Fest” and “Cinco de Mayo Celebration” focused on educating and empowering communities to achieve better health and wellness by introducing them to the All of Us Research Program and other resources. 

In Houston, the Harris County Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection Aging and Disability Resource Center, collaborated with St. Matthews Church. “Coffee and Croissants”, ADRC discussed how the Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection utilizes All of Us Research Project to connect with the community.  We discussed the vulnerable population, and chronic disease. We also discussed All of Us and how to join the research project. We encouraged each participant to tell their doctors about All of Us as well as handed out masks.  

In New Orleans, the New Orleans Council on Aging continues to provide information regarding All of Us to Senior Centers as they continue to re-open and increase their population. They will also be collaborating with additional partners next month, such as Xavier University and LSU, in order to advance education of the All of Us Research Program.

In Shreveport, the Caddo Council on Aging held some drive-thru wellness events. Participants were able to receive information about resources and services offered in Caddo Parish. Individuals were also be able to receive COVID vaccines and information about the All of Us Research Program.

In Baton Rouge, the Capital Area Agency on Aging hosted some outreach events, as well as continue posting ""All of Us"" blog posts on their home page. They were also able to deliver some All of Us material to seniors in East Feliciana Parish.","","","","Remaining COVID restrictions continue to be the main challenge across all our partners, but with more and more restrictions being lifted, we are starting to plan more in-person events. In the meantime, we continue to host virtual events promoting the All of Us Research Program.","As always, we continue to learn of more engaging ways to work alongside different organizations and communities. The monthly meetings with other partners brings synergy with a focus on creative outreach and innovative in our methods of targeting new partnerships. Throughout this project year, we are learning to be creative and innovative in our methods of fostering new partnerships. We are also learning to be resourceful and to think outside of the box when it comes to capturing the attention of the community.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

We held team calls and calls with our various health committees for a Mental Health awareness event called “Avoid Suffering in Silence” which was centered around suicide prevention and PTSD. This was a collaborative event with our Health and Wellness and Military Veteran Affairs Commission along with the United States Veteran Affairs. This was streamed via Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. We also worked on run-throughs along with assisting with creating the run of the show and engaging the partners with questions prior to the event. Assisted with the various tasks associated with the completion of our Rooted in Resilience Tour with the items left from the event along with coordinated pickup and drop off. Held recap discussion with the team on the event to discuss best practices and ways to improve for the future. Explored an opportunity to partner with an HPO in Minneapolis for a Heart Health event we had, which wasn’t successful, but will explore for future opportunities. Brainstormed with the internal team to consider future event ideas along with making sure we will have a presence at our Future Regional Conferences and Leadership events.","","Access to network, lack of network knowledge","Image and outlook","The challenges that were presented were more on a technology basis with some of our panelists for our web event on Mental Health. We were able to do a run-through as well as get them to log on earlier prior to the event to manage any troubleshooting issues to assure things would run smoothly","Marketing is always key to getting the information out. We also recognized that the information especially on Mental Health is vital. During our event, we had a participant mention several times he was dealing with depression and was having suicidal thoughts. We reached out to him personally and had one of the panelists, who is a mental health professional call him directly. As a result, the young man mentioned he would seek assistance.","We attended all weekly meetings as well as the Local Atlanta NIH Meeting. We held briefing sessions to discuss our upcoming events as well as worked with our Social Media team to circulate All of Us information. We met with our panel for our Mental Health event to highlight Mental Health Awareness month. We conducted an overview of the All of Us Research Program along with offering the Pre and Post Test survey for our viewers to complete. We attempted to engage the Minneapolis HPO to participate in a Heart Health Event that was held in Minneapolis, MN but was not successful. We are always brainstorming different innovative ideas to push the envelope with the All of Us Research Program. Shared not only via Social Media but our internal membership database information regarding the All of Us Research Program and how to get involved. Met with the team along with partner organization to discuss future events and how to include the clinical research aspect.","It Takes Courage to ask for Help","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""

As previously discussed, we know that the focus is on research and retention. As such our idea to keep our table talk format will allow us some flexibility in engaging researchers and physicians that work with HPOs. We found that our format has been very successful as a virtual event, however, we are planning one hybrid event. The event will be broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube. We have identified several speakers for the upcoming events; we have had preliminary discussions with a large NPHC Council that is located in one of the market cities. We assisted with and/or participated in Sigma Gamma Rho's recent event.","","","","The collective BGLC organizations have each expressed concerns about the current expected delivery of the All of Us message during events. Several strategies are being reviewed to ensure that we honor the expectations of the program while creating strategies to keep our constituents engaged, with the presentation. Some of our ideas include making the NIH information more engaging so that the All of Us message flows through our activations seamlessly and connects with our participants. For example, we would incorporate the presentation about All of Us in a way that makes for a smoother transition with our content.","As a result of participating in the CPGI Spring Engagement reviewing the CPGI Day Resources and Evaluation email, we gained greater insight into the trajectory of the All of Us program since Phase I. The growth and reach of the program are a direct result of all of the partnerships and the creative ideas for activations by the partners on all levels. We recognize that this program is ever-evolving and that our participation requires us to continue to evolve with the needs of the program. BGLC as a collective did a really good job of engaging our communities and enhancing awareness, but our work now will need to have a greater focus on research and retention. It is important to note that in Phase VI and Phase VII that we had begun moving in those directions with the development of the Rooted in Research and the Minority Student Research Symposium.","This month we participated in all BGLC Meetings. We participated in our weekly planning meetings for NPHC. We participated in and supported events hosted by other BGLC organizations. We worked on our strategy document for phase VIII. We registered for and participated in the CPGI Spring Engagement. Although we could not stay for the entire meeting due to scheduling conflicts, we did review the CPGI Day Resources and Evaluation email, which gave us time to do a deeper dive into the statement of work document and the CPGI presentation.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","",""
