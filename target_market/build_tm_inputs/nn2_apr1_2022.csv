Turnaround time on shareables was tough, and sharing the Google doc wasn’t useful for our comms team, because they couldn’t access the images linked from the asset portal. We did eventually get those to them, but it would be easier to have all the tools in one zip drive or folder for simple access.",Continued conversation with our engagement counselor will help us overcome some of the obstacles,Researchers continue to struggle with work bench. Moving forward with communication with program leadership thanks to strong help from our engagement counselor.,,,"Our Affiliates with journal awards have started to publish!

This meeting arose from a Spring Engagement Meeting panel Dr. Bennet participated.  The DRC invited Dr. Bennett, via our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla, to give feedback on the lack of an option to stratify All of Us data for rural areas, as he spoke about in the panel. Dr. Bennett offered the idea of creating a rural variable, rather than using zip codes, for privacy reasons; he also discussed how beneficial it would be for community groups to be able to access the AoU data in summary form; it would give them more information about their communities. The summary (and deidentified) data could be used for funding opportunities, community needs assessments or more. The Program’s data could be used for improving community health beyond its use by data scientists.  Dr. Bennett will speak more with the DRC, along with his colleague Dr. Samuel Baxter of Clemson University to discuss institutions and their data user agreements. NRHA members learned about the Workbench and looked to establish a data user agreement for their university so they could access the data, they found one existed already, but they have never heard about. It seems like even the existence of the AoU data user agreement can be siloed among universities.",,NRHA appreciates the DRC’s invitation to Dr. Bennett to discuss barriers to both rural participation in the Program and the Workbench.  We look forward to continuing to discuss these barriers and potential solutions in Cycle 4.,"This month being June, our sub-awardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, shared the Pride Month content that the Program provided. LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert shared this about the engagement with the content:  

“I wanted to note that we had more engagement on June’s posts than any other month.  However, not all of the engagement was positive.  The majority of the comments we received were anti-LGBTQ+ (since the posts were related to Pride Month).  None of them rose to the level of hate comments so I did not delete or respond to them.  They were generally along the lines of “being gay is a mental illness/sin” and similar comments.  Some comments were rebuttals to these comments.  I will still count all engagement regardless of the type in the reporting but just wanted to share for your information.” 

If the Program has any specific drafted responses that we should provide to our subawardees or if they would like to discuss the LRHA’s experience with Ms. Herbert, we are happy to help in anyway possible. Or perhaps in Cycle 4, NRHA can discuss potential responses with our communications team lead that we can share with our subawardees.","NRHA subawardees were slow to provide their social media metrics. While NRHA staffer Lea Mann has created submission forms for our subawardees to provider their social media data, NNRHA plans to continue enhancing our reporting system for our subawardees and partners in Cycle 4. 

NRHA’s sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association (LRHA) had an All of Us related post denied by Facebook when trying to post the content. Facebook provided the following explanation for its rejection of the post, “it doesn’t comply with our Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics policy.” The post content included a Pride Month video asset along with the caption, “Black gay men are the only population in which new HIV cases have been growing since 2001. The @AllofUsResearch Program aims to help reduce health disparities like this by making sure there is real representation in health research. When there is actual diversity, researchers can learn more about our differences. This #Pride2022, you can help too if you sign up and #JoinAllofUs at JoinAllofUs.org/Together.”  LRHA resolved to not post the content but did inform NRHA of the issue they ran into so we may make the Program aware of this hurdle.","NRHA continues to learn more about existing assets in the asset portal that can be used by our subawardees in numerous ways. It was great to be able to provide several flyers in both English and Spanish for the Arizona Rural Health Conference through the AzRHA’s exhibit space.  

Another lesson learned was that even though the Program, and NRHA, have been educating our stakeholders for years, there is still opportunity to reach those who have either not been informed or those who do not have complete information about the Program. We look forward to continuing, modifying, and expanding our engagement efforts in Cycle 4.","Between May 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings. Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us observances of Pride Month, Men’s Health Week, and World Sickle Cell Day social media toolkits through our platforms.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.  

Donating your data to the program is like donating to your community, the research gets closer to home, impacting health outcomes in your community. If not, those in power are making health decisions about you without you.","At the end of June, NRHA received an outline on an All of Us-centric Community Health Worker (CHW) Training by Janel Lowman, a certified community health worker trainer. NRHA contracted with Ms. Lowman earlier in the cycle to develop this outline, as NRHA believes that CHWs can be a key resource in engaging and educating rural populations about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has since reviewed and made comments on this outline and has also sent it to our engagement and communication counselors for their review and comment. NRHA has invited Janel Lowman to our weekly meeting with our counselors from Pyxis to discuss her work and what action we will be taking in Cycle 4 to move this project forward.  

Through the Engagement Incubator, NRHA staffer Laura Hudson connected with Daniel Moretti of Standford PrideNet. Daniel, Laura, and Lea met on June 1st and discussed several ways to collaborate especially in the new Target Market of California. In Cycle 4, we discussed PrideNet serving as a speaker on the podcast for the California State Rural Health Association to discuss AoU. We also discussed connecting their regional coordinators with our subawardees and other state rural health associations. There may also be interest in working together on either a virtual “fireside chat” or perhaps rural specific materials for their target population. NRHA is excited about this new collaboration in Cycle 4 made possible, in part, by the Program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Rural Health Association (NRHA),0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No, ,MSR,0,Admin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,No,"NRHA’s “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett, University of South Carolina, had the opportunity to meet with the Data Research Center (DRC).

NRHA’s sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association (LRHA) had an All of Us related post denied by Facebook when trying to post the content. Facebook provided the following explanation for its rejection of the post, “it doesn’t comply with our Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics policy.” The post content included a Pride Month video asset along with the caption, “Black gay men are the only population in which new HIV cases have been growing since 2001. The @AllofUsResearch Program aims to help reduce health disparities like this by making sure there is real representation in health research. When there is actual diversity, researchers can learn more about our differences. This #Pride2022, you can help too if you sign up and #JoinAllofUs at JoinAllofUs.org/Together.”  LRHA resolved to not post the content but did inform NRHA of the issue they ran into so we may make the Program aware of this hurdle.","NRHA continues to learn more about existing assets in the asset portal that can be used by our subawardees in numerous ways. It was great to be able to provide several flyers in both English and Spanish for the Arizona Rural Health Conference through the AzRHA’s exhibit space.  

Another lesson learned was that even though the Program, and NRHA, have been educating our stakeholders for years, there is still opportunity to reach those who have either not been informed or those who do not have complete information about the Program. We look forward to continuing, modifying, and expanding our engagement efforts in Cycle 4.",NRHA appreciates the DRC’s invitation to Dr. Bennett to discuss barriers to both rural participation in the Program and the Workbench.  We look forward to continuing to discuss these barriers and potential solutions in Cycle 4.,"Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.  

Donating your data to the program is like donating to your community, the research gets closer to home, impacting health outcomes in your community. If not, those in power are making health decisions about you without you.","This month being June, our sub-awardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, shared the Pride Month content that the Program provided. LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert shared this about the engagement with the content:  

“I wanted to note that we had more engagement on June’s posts than any other month.  However, not all of the engagement was positive.  The majority of the comments we received were anti-LGBTQ+ (since the posts were related to Pride Month).  None of them rose to the level of hate comments so I did not delete or respond to them.  They were generally along the lines of “being gay is a mental illness/sin” and similar comments.  Some comments were rebuttals to these comments.  I will still count all engagement regardless of the type in the reporting but just wanted to share for your information.” 

If the Program has any specific drafted responses that we should provide to our subawardees or if they would like to discuss the LRHA’s experience with Ms. Herbert, we are happy to help in anyway possible. Or perhaps in Cycle 4, NRHA can discuss potential responses with our communications team lead that we can share with our subawardees.","At the end of June, NRHA received an outline on an All of Us-centric Community Health Worker (CHW) Training by Janel Lowman, a certified community health worker trainer. NRHA contracted with Ms. Lowman earlier in the cycle to develop this outline, as NRHA believes that CHWs can be a key resource in engaging and educating rural populations about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has since reviewed and made comments on this outline and has also sent it to our engagement and communication counselors for their review and comment. NRHA has invited Janel Lowman to our weekly meeting with our counselors from Pyxis to discuss her work and what action we will be taking in Cycle 4 to move this project forward.  

Through the Engagement Incubator, NRHA staffer Laura Hudson connected with Daniel Moretti of Standford PrideNet. Daniel, Laura, and Lea met on June 1st and discussed several ways to collaborate especially in the new Target Market of California. In Cycle 4, we discussed PrideNet serving as a speaker on the podcast for the California State Rural Health Association to discuss AoU. We also discussed connecting their regional coordinators with our subawardees and other state rural health associations. There may also be interest in working together on either a virtual “fireside chat” or perhaps rural specific materials for their target population. NRHA is excited about this new collaboration in Cycle 4 made possible, in part, by the Program.","Between May 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings. Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us observances of Pride Month, Men’s Health Week, and World Sickle Cell Day social media toolkits through our platforms."

With this being a virtual event, we need to review areas in which we can more heavily promote the significance of our All of Us content to better engage attendees and channel them into being more active","We've identified that there is strong community curiosity in the potential advantages of participation. We now look to create a campaign that features community figures and leaders to encourage enrollment and highlight benefits. 

We have connected with our LSU enrollment partner to develop a series of events that provide more details in programming and enrollment for our community.",Lack of relatable community figures who have completed enrollment in programs and share their experiences.,Participating in the All of Us Research Program presents individualized healthcare opportunities,"Overall community tone shows interest in learning more about available opportunities, but there is hesitation in being unable to directly connect program's benefits with community members they identify with.  Data privacy and trust continue to be a concern",,"Weekly check-ins with our Engagement Partner in preparation for our event, and to focus on helpful strategies in developing our All of Us engagement strategies moving forward."
