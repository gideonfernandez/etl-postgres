Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the Spring Engagement Meeting, Annual CPGI Meeting, target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us AAPI Heritage Month, Mental Health Awareness Month, National Arab American Heritage Month, and Older Americans Month social media toolkits through our platforms. NRHA also discussed a potential paid co-branded Facebook opportunity with our engagement counselor.  

Most notably, on Thursday, May 12, 2022, NRHA hosted AoU Chief Engagement Officer Dr. Karriem Watson in-person at our Annual Rural Health Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico as the Terry Reilly Keynote Speaker. Dr. Watson presented an information session titled, “The All of Us Research Program: Engaging Rural Communities to Achieve Health Equity.” Dr. Watson successfully engaged an audience of around 200 rural health professionals with his personal journey in precision medicine research and with facts and figures on the All of Us Research Program. The audience was curious to know how the Program can and will do more to engage rural populations. Dr. Watson was able to have honest, reflective answers for the audience on how he sees the program can do more to engage rural populations in the Program. After Dr. Watson’s presentations, NRHA and TX AHEC East Waco Region waited outside the lecture hall with signs that directed the audience to engage with us if they had further questions about the Program.  

As mentioned in previous reports, at NRHA’s Annual Conference, NRHA co-hosted an All of Us Research Program exhibit with TX AHEC East, Waco Region. The Conference boasted a healthy attendance of 843 people. Ashley Bearden and Micah Bolden of TX AHEC East, Waco Region traveled to NM to staff the All of Us booth, along with NRHA staff Laura Hudson and Lea Mann. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla also staffed this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, as needed.  NRHA ordered all the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco provided the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla met with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference.  

In May, NRHA coordinated with our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla and our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett to have Dr. Bennet participate in a panel on May 4, 2022, during the 2022 Spring Engagement Meeting. The panel was titled, “Building a diverse All of Us Researcher Community: Highlights of impactful engagement activities.” In this panel, Program researchers shared their impactful strategies and activities that can be used to inform future work by additional program partners. Dr. Bennett specifically spoke about the barriers when conducting rural health research on the All of Us research workbench. Dr. Bennett expressed the following barriers to conducting precision medicine research in rural populations: availability of data and equitable data; by this Dr. Bennett expanded to say that the datasets never cover all aspects of rural, as smaller areas get lost in the shuffle in larger counties that are urban. Moreover, participation from rural populations is missing because of lack of transportation or time to go to large care centers, and when they do get to the large health centers, it’s hard to talk to people because they are dealing with a myriad of other health issues. Lastly, it is hard for rural community leaders to navigate the data because they are not part of a larger university or organization that can provide support as they engage in the workbench. From this panel, we have seen positive feedback, as our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla reached out to Dr. Bennett after his panel to ask him to join a conversation with the Data Research Center (DRC), as DRC had brought up the lack of an option to stratify data for rural areas.  Our Engagement Counselor is currently coordinating with Dr. Bennett to set up a meeting between him and the DRC to discuss this lack of an option among other concerns of rural researchers on the All of Us workbench. 

This month, NRHA met with its sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association to discuss their strategy & budget for the remainder of Cycle 3. NRHA’s engagement counselor was able to join the call and have a very productive conversation with LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert on allocating remaining funds to in-person event assets, such as a vertical banner, tablecloth, table signs, etc. LRHA plans to further connect with our Communications Counselor Rob Bartnichak about LRHA branded asset creation.  LRHA also shared the All of Us social media observances in May; those social media engagements have been entered into Network Ninja.  

In Arizona, this month, NRHA met with AZ Rural Health Association leadership to discuss their activities as collaborators for the remainder of Cycle 3 and their interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as sub-awardees and participants in the developing Arizona Target Market. From this conversation, AzRHA proposed hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit at an upcoming rural health conference in June that AZRHA is co-sponsoring (48th Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference). NRHA and our engagement counselor believe that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Program to Arizona rural health stakeholders. AZRHA is currently working on a Cycle 3 proposal to include this new activity. NRHA has checked with All of Us partner ASU Banner Health on their exhibitor status but have yet to receive a response; we do not want the All of Us presence to be redundant.  Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a sub-awardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. NRHA is awaiting a proposed budget from CSRHA for their efforts in the remainder of Cycle 3. We have decided to begin podcast engagement in Cycle 4, so we have time to plan the best fit speakers for the content.  

Finally, NRHA staff Laura Hudson participate in the quarterly Engagement Incubator. The group focused on developing games focused on the AoU Research Program that could keep partners/participants engaged and would encourage new partners/participants to join or learn more about the Program. The EI meeting allowed Mrs. Hudson to connect again with a representative from CPGI Partner PrideNet to set a time to discuss possible ways our two groups and/or or subawardees could collaborate. The meeting will take place on June 1.",,"NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general. 

NRHA has begun to discuss more with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett on the barriers to participation and ease of access to data by rural researchers working on the All of Us Research Program workbench.","A NRHA member expressed concern with the context of a AoU social media message NRHA posted on our Facebook page. The particular post is listed here: ""LGBTQ+ individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and substance misuse compared to heterosexual individuals. The @AllofUsResearch Program is looking to uncover answers to disparities like this by increasing representation in research. When you #JoinAllofUs, you can help researchers find out these important answers. Get started at joinallofus.org/together #MHAM"" 

The NRHA member’s comment focused on that there are “real and dangerous social conditions that can influence depression, anxiety, etc.” but that “the premise of All of Us is that genetics are the answer to everything.” 

NRHA resolved their concern by taking down the post and replying directly to our member about the Programs work on surveying for social determinants of health and included language such as, ""All of Us Research Program does not just look at genetic material for their datasets and precision medicine initiative.  They have social determinants of health surveys and other types of qualitative research to address/better understand non-genetic factors to an individual’s health."" and ""As always, NRHA aims to work with partners such as All of Us to better understand the connection between mental and physical health and increase the representation of underserved populations in health research. That was our goal with this post, though we would be happy to discuss any additional concerns via messenger. Thanks for your feedback and for being such a valuable rural health advocate!"" 

NRHA staff will talk with our engagement counselor and comms lead during our Thursday meeting more about this comment. This is a good reminder that NRHA has more opportunity to get the full message of the full scope of the Program out to our researchers and members. 
The NRHA member expressed in their comment on the post that they understood the Program to strictly define disparities through genetics. Because of this understanding, they believed that NRHA and All of Us were ignoring the social determinants of health that may contribute to the increased levels of anxiety, depression, and substance misuse in LGBTQ+ populations, as compared to heterosexual populations.

That was our goal with this post, though we would be happy to discuss any additional concerns via messenger. Thanks for your feedback and for being such a valuable rural health advocate!""","A challenge experienced in May was when NRHA began to create new activities and reports in the new version of Network Ninja. NRHA staff member Lea Mann wanted to create a May Monthly report in Network Ninja to review the questions before drafting but could not seem to choose the correct setting in Network Ninja for the monthly report questions to populate. In order to resolve the frustration, Lea went back to the Network Ninja training provided by Pyxis to go through the motions of creating a monthly report while watching the tutorial video. Lea then took notes on the procedure for next month, hoping this will create more ease in June and the further months coming.","Pertaining to the troubleshooting issues in the new version of Network Ninja, NRHA has learned that it is important to slow down and revert to primary trainings, even in the routine reporting process, to ensure that proper and accurate reporting is conducted.

In May, NRHA learned that engaging All of Us Research Program leadership about rural representation in the Program is just as important as engaging rural populations across the country. For example, Dr. Watson presented an alarmingly low statistic on the percentage of rural population enrolled in the Program.  Since engaging with the audience on how and what the Program will do to improve rural enrollment, Dr. Watson has become more enthusiastic about getting the Program more involved with rural instead of just the other way around.","Between April 30, 2022, and May 31, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Spring Engagement Meeting, and the Annual CPGI Network Meeting.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.

Dr. Watson’s audience during the Terry Reilly Keynote Lecture especially appreciated the messaging describing opening the communication lines even further between rural communities and providers with the Program through NRHA. Dr. Watson encouraged lecture participants to connect with NRHA to find All of Us partners in their near area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes, ,MSR,0,Admin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,Yes,"May was jampacked with programming for NRHA and its sub-awardees when talking about the All of Us Research Program.

Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a sub-awardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. NRHA is awaiting a proposed budget from CSRHA for their efforts in the remainder of Cycle 3. We have decided to begin podcast engagement in Cycle 4, so we have time to plan the best fit speakers for the content.  

Finally, NRHA staff Laura Hudson participate in the quarterly Engagement Incubator. The group focused on developing games focused on the AoU Research Program that could keep partners/participants engaged and would encourage new partners/participants to join or learn more about the Program. The EI meeting allowed Mrs. Hudson to connect again with a representative from CPGI Partner PrideNet to set a time to discuss possible ways our two groups and/or or subawardees could collaborate. The meeting will take place on June 1.","A challenge experienced in May was when NRHA began to create new activities and reports in the new version of Network Ninja. NRHA staff member Lea Mann wanted to create a May Monthly report in Network Ninja to review the questions before drafting but could not seem to choose the correct setting in Network Ninja for the monthly report questions to populate. In order to resolve the frustration, Lea went back to the Network Ninja training provided by Pyxis to go through the motions of creating a monthly report while watching the tutorial video. Lea then took notes on the procedure for next month, hoping this will create more ease in June and the further months coming.","Pertaining to the troubleshooting issues in the new version of Network Ninja, NRHA has learned that it is important to slow down and revert to primary trainings, even in the routine reporting process, to ensure that proper and accurate reporting is conducted.

In May, NRHA learned that engaging All of Us Research Program leadership about rural representation in the Program is just as important as engaging rural populations across the country. For example, Dr. Watson presented an alarmingly low statistic on the percentage of rural population enrolled in the Program.  Since engaging with the audience on how and what the Program will do to improve rural enrollment, Dr. Watson has become more enthusiastic about getting the Program more involved with rural instead of just the other way around.","NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general. 

NRHA has begun to discuss more with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett on the barriers to participation and ease of access to data by rural researchers working on the All of Us Research Program workbench.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.

Dr. Watson’s audience during the Terry Reilly Keynote Lecture especially appreciated the messaging describing opening the communication lines even further between rural communities and providers with the Program through NRHA. Dr. Watson encouraged lecture participants to connect with NRHA to find All of Us partners in their near area.","A NRHA member expressed concern with the context of a AoU social media message NRHA posted on our Facebook page. The particular post is listed here: ""LGBTQ+ individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and substance misuse compared to heterosexual individuals. The @AllofUsResearch Program is looking to uncover answers to disparities like this by increasing representation in research. When you #JoinAllofUs, you can help researchers find out these important answers. Get started at joinallofus.org/together #MHAM"" 

The NRHA member’s comment focused on that there are “real and dangerous social conditions that can influence depression, anxiety, etc.” but that “the premise of All of Us is that genetics are the answer to everything.” 

NRHA resolved their concern by taking down the post and replying directly to our member about the Programs work on surveying for social determinants of health and included language such as, ""All of Us Research Program does not just look at genetic material for their datasets and precision medicine initiative.  They have social determinants of health surveys and other types of qualitative research to address/better understand non-genetic factors to an individual’s health."" and ""As always, NRHA aims to work with partners such as All of Us to better understand the connection between mental and physical health and increase the representation of underserved populations in health research. That was our goal with this post, though we would be happy to discuss any additional concerns via messenger. Thanks for your feedback and for being such a valuable rural health advocate!"" 

NRHA staff will talk with our engagement counselor and comms lead during our Thursday meeting more about this comment. This is a good reminder that NRHA has more opportunity to get the full message of the full scope of the Program out to our researchers and members. 
The NRHA member expressed in their comment on the post that they understood the Program to strictly define disparities through genetics. Because of this understanding, they believed that NRHA and All of Us were ignoring the social determinants of health that may contribute to the increased levels of anxiety, depression, and substance misuse in LGBTQ+ populations, as compared to heterosexual populations.

NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Spring Engagement Meeting, and the Annual CPGI Network Meeting."

The center continues to develop a better understanding of how AHECs can support the All of Us program through our experience and the opportunities provided by Pyxis to collaborate with AHEC/THEARI and the WA Ecosystem.,,"The main challenge is capacity at this time.  However, the AHEC is actively working to address this issue.","Center capacity has been a challenge this year.  It was expected that center staff would need to be flexible to delivery of media work on virtual and in-person events.  However, the challenges of staffing and hiring during the pandemic were new with many organizations in the AHEC network impacted by the great resignation.  This had internal implications, but also impacted AHEC external partners and contacts. 

The AHEC hired two more part-time hourly staff in March and spent time onboarding and training during the month of April.  This was challenging to administer during our planned travel months for the All of Us Program, but also a positive for the center. Lesly Pumay was added to the All of Us program grant work at the center to support social media work. She is graduating this year with a BFA in Design from Cornish College of Arts.  The AHECWW working diligently to launch a social media campaign as a part of our All of Us grant before the close of the fiscal year. 

The center also interviewed candidates and hired one new full-time position to start in May. These efforts will significantly improve center capacity across grant work. The AHECWW continues to push forward identifying strategies to maintain and deliver grant tasks to the best of staff ability and capacity, while addressing any deficiencies","During the Western Forum, Cori Garcia Hansen became ill with an upper respiratory infection.  She was then not allowed to participate in the in-person conference.  However, the AHECWW center sent two staff, so Carlos Morales, was able to cover the event activities.  The AHECWW also had the support of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health.  Overall, the task was delivered successfully.   

As the AHECWW looks forward to the opportunity to continue participation with the All of Us Program, the center has reflected on its niche and role in the work in the WA Ecosystem.  The education and awareness piece seems complimentary to the work to build support among health professionals working in underserved communities.  Ultimately, this will help with recruitment and retention.  We also continue to provide information about the research work bench to the health professions student and professional audience. The AHEC needs to learn more about how to best evaluate and survey participants in programming to serve the other collaborative efforts in the region and goals of the program.  As the development of the WA Ecosystem group is new, the center is optimistic about the opportunities to collaborate and form a streamlined approach with tangible outcomes in support of regional partners.","With the ongoing challenges during the pandemic, the experience with event coverage demonstrated the importance of back-up plans and staffing when unforeseen factors like illness impact the work.","The AHECWW participated in the CPGI Engagement Counseling meeting and the National AHEC Organization All of Us Program presentation.

As part of our virtual activities, we co-hosted the Perspectives from Health Researchers in Advancing Health Equity in Diverse Communities: Part 1” webinar alongside the Diverse Elders Coalition (DEC).

We had over 100 attendees who joined the discussion with a panel of experts to learn about persisting health inequities and barriers that have prevented communities of color, LGBTQ+ communities, American Indian/Alaska Native communities, and others from participating in health research and how the All of Us Research Program aims to resolve these inequities, making it easier for diverse communities to participate in health research.

We continue to meet weekly with our CPGI engagement counselor to troubleshoot any issues as they arise.,"It has been great to start planning ahead of time for the upcoming All of Us Research Program deliverables that we need to accomplish for this new funding cycle. Along with our engagement counselor and the communications team, we are keeping track of the timeline related to the activities for this funding cycle. One of the lessons learned during this month was sharing the May 26th webinar’s promotional materials (ex. flyers and RSVP link that the communications team helped us develop) for the Miami, DMV, and NY market to promote the webinar, along with sharing it in the CPGI digest e-newsletter.","Due to the ongoing pandemic, we are conducting most of our events in a virtual setting. When we do conduct in-person events (e.g., bingo game) we make it a contactless experience. Meanwhile, we have been active on social media and doing virtual activities to promote the program and enrollment.",,,,"This month, we participated in weekly meetings with our engagement counselor to continue working on our activities for this new funding cycle. Also, we joined the CPGI monthly call and the Miami and DMV market calls. NHCOA also has its own weekly internal meetings to manage All of Us activities."
