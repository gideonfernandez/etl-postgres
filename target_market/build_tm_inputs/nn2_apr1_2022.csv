""This was a great opportunity to learn more about the program, spread knowledge about the program, and interact with the community to help make people become more involved in the future of medicine.""",,,"This month's activities included check-ins with each of our student ambassadors, attendance at the Denver Market meeting, we hosted our last internal THEARI team meeting, met with Banner Health to prepare for our co-hosted webinar, four student ambassador activities including two tabling activities and two remote presentations, tabling at the National Forum of Nursing Workforce Centers Conference in Las Vegas, hosted a Zoom celebration for our student ambassadors, co-hosted a webinar with Banner Health, bi-monthly check-ins with Lin, and attended my 1:1 check-in with Julia."

Guidance on what we are allowed to share with other community partners would be appreciated as we care about our programs and want to re-home them if possible.","One of the best resonating messages include the kudos provided by Julia during the monthly 1:1 check-in. Lin shared this with the THEARI team, highlighting Abigail's dedication to the All of Us Research Program.

Additional positive messaging came from THEARI Board of Directors and staff as well as Banner Health staff that tabled at the Denver Colfax Marathon:

""The event was definitely a success, and we reached out to many people! Dr. Michael Bradfield & Kaylee Hambek from Banner Health were absolutely fantastic and very experienced. Kaylee was in front of the booth, engaging people coming by, and many people trusted in Dr. Bradfield since he was a physician providing insight into personalized medicine.""

""Our table was positioned between several other pretty high profile tables, making it easy to chat with people, and I was impressed by how many people where genuinely interested once they started hearing about the AoU opportunity.""",,,"This month's activities included attendance at the Spring Engagement Meeting, student ambassador check-ins, attendance at the AHEC/THEARI group meeting, attendance at the Denver Market meeting, hosted an internal All of Us THEARI team meeting, THEARI staff and student ambassadors along with Banner Health staff tabled at the Denver Colfax Marathon, Deandra presented to the Osteopathic Medical Student Coalition at RVU in a hybrid format, Ciauna tabled with Banner Health staff at the Mile High Flea Market, Mikaela hosted a presentation with the administration/faculty at Stuart Middle School, Miryam hosted a presentation with RVU medical students, attendance at CPGI day, and 1:1 check-in with Julia. Due to so many student ambassadors events this month, a significant amount of time was dedicated to supporting our students and ensuring they had exactly what they needed to be successful."

When she was on board last year in June the scope of work and budget had already been submitted and in the review process.,,,,Engagement Counselor Mae Sandberg facilitated a connection between LULAC and COSSMA of Puerto Rico. A meeting will be scheduled for both organizations to collaborate and support one another when activities coincide in Puerto Rico.,"During the month of July LULAC worked closely with our engagement counselor, Rima Matsumoto, to develop a scope of work for cycle 4. LULAC is proud of the plan we have developed throughout the year. We knew that we wanted to have multiple touch points for participants and more events that are bilingual. The strategy we have put together aligns with the program’s five year goal of increasing enrollment in the program. A previous goal of the program was to increase awareness and provide insight into the mission of the program. This meant hosting general events to explain and provide an introduction to the program. LULAC wants to continue introducing the program to our growing membership base and with time expand to additional markets that we service and align with programming. However, we now want to have a more direct and clear call to action of enrolling. 
Lastly this month, Rima and the LULAC team have been discussing the execution plan for the 2022 LULAC National Convention that is taking place in San Juan, PR in late July.  We have discussed outreach, exhibiting and speaking opportunities.  We also submitted our budget and scope of work for this upcoming cycle 2022-2023."

This meeting arose from a Spring Engagement Meeting panel Dr. Bennet participated.  The DRC invited Dr. Bennett, via our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla, to give feedback on the lack of an option to stratify All of Us data for rural areas, as he spoke about in the panel. Dr. Bennett offered the idea of creating a rural variable, rather than using zip codes, for privacy reasons; he also discussed how beneficial it would be for community groups to be able to access the AoU data in summary form; it would give them more information about their communities. The summary (and deidentified) data could be used for funding opportunities, community needs assessments or more. The Program’s data could be used for improving community health beyond its use by data scientists.  Dr. Bennett will speak more with the DRC, along with his colleague Dr. Samuel Baxter of Clemson University to discuss institutions and their data user agreements. NRHA members learned about the Workbench and looked to establish a data user agreement for their university so they could access the data, they found one existed already, but they have never heard about. It seems like even the existence of the AoU data user agreement can be siloed among universities.",,NRHA appreciates the DRC’s invitation to Dr. Bennett to discuss barriers to both rural participation in the Program and the Workbench.  We look forward to continuing to discuss these barriers and potential solutions in Cycle 4.,"This month being June, our sub-awardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, shared the Pride Month content that the Program provided. LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert shared this about the engagement with the content:  

“I wanted to note that we had more engagement on June’s posts than any other month.  However, not all of the engagement was positive.  The majority of the comments we received were anti-LGBTQ+ (since the posts were related to Pride Month).  None of them rose to the level of hate comments so I did not delete or respond to them.  They were generally along the lines of “being gay is a mental illness/sin” and similar comments.  Some comments were rebuttals to these comments.  I will still count all engagement regardless of the type in the reporting but just wanted to share for your information.” 

If the Program has any specific drafted responses that we should provide to our subawardees or if they would like to discuss the LRHA’s experience with Ms. Herbert, we are happy to help in anyway possible. Or perhaps in Cycle 4, NRHA can discuss potential responses with our communications team lead that we can share with our subawardees.","NRHA subawardees were slow to provide their social media metrics. While NRHA staffer Lea Mann has created submission forms for our subawardees to provider their social media data, NNRHA plans to continue enhancing our reporting system for our subawardees and partners in Cycle 4. 

NRHA’s sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association (LRHA) had an All of Us related post denied by Facebook when trying to post the content. Facebook provided the following explanation for its rejection of the post, “it doesn’t comply with our Ads About Social Issues, Elections or Politics policy.” The post content included a Pride Month video asset along with the caption, “Black gay men are the only population in which new HIV cases have been growing since 2001. The @AllofUsResearch Program aims to help reduce health disparities like this by making sure there is real representation in health research. When there is actual diversity, researchers can learn more about our differences. This #Pride2022, you can help too if you sign up and #JoinAllofUs at JoinAllofUs.org/Together.”  LRHA resolved to not post the content but did inform NRHA of the issue they ran into so we may make the Program aware of this hurdle.","NRHA continues to learn more about existing assets in the asset portal that can be used by our subawardees in numerous ways. It was great to be able to provide several flyers in both English and Spanish for the Arizona Rural Health Conference through the AzRHA’s exhibit space.  

Another lesson learned was that even though the Program, and NRHA, have been educating our stakeholders for years, there is still opportunity to reach those who have either not been informed or those who do not have complete information about the Program. We look forward to continuing, modifying, and expanding our engagement efforts in Cycle 4.","Between May 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings. Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us observances of Pride Month, Men’s Health Week, and World Sickle Cell Day social media toolkits through our platforms.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.  

Donating your data to the program is like donating to your community, the research gets closer to home, impacting health outcomes in your community. If not, those in power are making health decisions about you without you.","At the end of June, NRHA received an outline on an All of Us-centric Community Health Worker (CHW) Training by Janel Lowman, a certified community health worker trainer. NRHA contracted with Ms. Lowman earlier in the cycle to develop this outline, as NRHA believes that CHWs can be a key resource in engaging and educating rural populations about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has since reviewed and made comments on this outline and has also sent it to our engagement and communication counselors for their review and comment. NRHA has invited Janel Lowman to our weekly meeting with our counselors from Pyxis to discuss her work and what action we will be taking in Cycle 4 to move this project forward.  

Through the Engagement Incubator, NRHA staffer Laura Hudson connected with Daniel Moretti of Standford PrideNet. Daniel, Laura, and Lea met on June 1st and discussed several ways to collaborate especially in the new Target Market of California. In Cycle 4, we discussed PrideNet serving as a speaker on the podcast for the California State Rural Health Association to discuss AoU. We also discussed connecting their regional coordinators with our subawardees and other state rural health associations.

2022-05-27,NRHA / Cycle 3 May 2022 Monthly Report,20233,,Finished,CPGI,Monthly Summary Report,Monthly Summary Report,50 F St NW,Washington,DC,20001,Admin,Not a target market,8,,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,"May was jampacked with programming for NRHA and its sub-awardees when talking about the All of Us Research Program. Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the Spring Engagement Meeting, Annual CPGI Meeting, target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us AAPI Heritage Month, Mental Health Awareness Month, National Arab American Heritage Month, and Older Americans Month social media toolkits through our platforms. NRHA also discussed a potential paid co-branded Facebook opportunity with our engagement counselor.  

Most notably, on Thursday, May 12, 2022, NRHA hosted AoU Chief Engagement Officer Dr. Karriem Watson in-person at our Annual Rural Health Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico as the Terry Reilly Keynote Speaker. Dr. Watson presented an information session titled, “The All of Us Research Program: Engaging Rural Communities to Achieve Health Equity.” Dr. Watson successfully engaged an audience of around 200 rural health professionals with his personal journey in precision medicine research and with facts and figures on the All of Us Research Program. The audience was curious to know how the Program can and will do more to engage rural populations. Dr. Watson was able to have honest, reflective answers for the audience on how he sees the program can do more to engage rural populations in the Program. After Dr. Watson’s presentations, NRHA and TX AHEC East Waco Region waited outside the lecture hall with signs that directed the audience to engage with us if they had further questions about the Program.  

As mentioned in previous reports, at NRHA’s Annual Conference, NRHA co-hosted an All of Us Research Program exhibit with TX AHEC East, Waco Region. The Conference boasted a healthy attendance of 843 people. Ashley Bearden and Micah Bolden of TX AHEC East, Waco Region traveled to NM to staff the All of Us booth, along with NRHA staff Laura Hudson and Lea Mann. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla also staffed this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, as needed.  NRHA ordered all the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco provided the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla met with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference.  

In May, NRHA coordinated with our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla and our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett to have Dr. Bennet participate in a panel on May 4, 2022, during the 2022 Spring Engagement Meeting. The panel was titled, “Building a diverse All of Us Researcher Community: Highlights of impactful engagement activities.” In this panel, Program researchers shared their impactful strategies and activities that can be used to inform future work by additional program partners. Dr. Bennett specifically spoke about the barriers when conducting rural health research on the All of Us research workbench. Dr. Bennett expressed the following barriers to conducting precision medicine research in rural populations: availability of data and equitable data; by this Dr. Bennett expanded to say that the datasets never cover all aspects of rural, as smaller areas get lost in the shuffle in larger counties that are urban. Moreover, participation from rural populations is missing because of lack of transportation or time to go to large care centers, and when they do get to the large health centers, it’s hard to talk to people because they are dealing with a myriad of other health issues. Lastly, it is hard for rural community leaders to navigate the data because they are not part of a larger university or organization that can provide support as they engage in the workbench. From this panel, we have seen positive feedback, as our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla reached out to Dr. Bennett after his panel to ask him to join a conversation with the Data Research Center (DRC), as DRC had brought up the lack of an option to stratify data for rural areas.  Our Engagement Counselor is currently coordinating with Dr. Bennett to set up a meeting between him and the DRC to discuss this lack of an option among other concerns of rural researchers on the All of Us workbench. 

This month, NRHA met with its sub-awardee the Louisiana Rural Health Association to discuss their strategy & budget for the remainder of Cycle 3. NRHA’s engagement counselor was able to join the call and have a very productive conversation with LRHA Executive Director Denae Hebert on allocating remaining funds to in-person event assets, such as a vertical banner, tablecloth, table signs, etc. LRHA plans to further connect with our Communications Counselor Rob Bartnichak about LRHA branded asset creation.  LRHA also shared the All of Us social media observances in May; those social media engagements have been entered into Network Ninja.  

In Arizona, this month, NRHA met with AZ Rural Health Association leadership to discuss their activities as collaborators for the remainder of Cycle 3 and their interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as sub-awardees and participants in the developing Arizona Target Market. From this conversation, AzRHA proposed hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit at an upcoming rural health conference in June that AZRHA is co-sponsoring (48th Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference). NRHA and our engagement counselor believe that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Program to Arizona rural health stakeholders. AZRHA is currently working on a Cycle 3 proposal to include this new activity. NRHA has checked with All of Us partner ASU Banner Health on their exhibitor status but have yet to receive a response; we do not want the All of Us presence to be redundant.  Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a sub-awardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. NRHA is awaiting a proposed budget from CSRHA for their efforts in the remainder of Cycle 3. We have decided to begin podcast engagement in Cycle 4, so we have time to plan the best fit speakers for the content.  

Finally, NRHA staff Laura Hudson participate in the quarterly Engagement Incubator. The group focused on developing games focused on the AoU Research Program that could keep partners/participants engaged and would encourage new partners/participants to join or learn more about the Program. The EI meeting allowed Mrs. Hudson to connect again with a representative from CPGI Partner PrideNet to set a time to discuss possible ways our two groups and/or or subawardees could collaborate. The meeting will take place on June 1.",,"NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general. 

NRHA has begun to discuss more with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett on the barriers to participation and ease of access to data by rural researchers working on the All of Us Research Program workbench.","A NRHA member expressed concern with the context of a AoU social media message NRHA posted on our Facebook page. The particular post is listed here: ""LGBTQ+ individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and substance misuse compared to heterosexual individuals. The @AllofUsResearch Program is looking to uncover answers to disparities like this by increasing representation in research. When you #JoinAllofUs, you can help researchers find out these important answers. Get started at joinallofus.org/together #MHAM"" 

The NRHA member’s comment focused on that there are “real and dangerous social conditions that can influence depression, anxiety, etc.” but that “the premise of All of Us is that genetics are the answer to everything.” 

NRHA resolved their concern by taking down the post and replying directly to our member about the Programs work on surveying for social determinants of health and included language such as, ""All of Us Research Program does not just look at genetic material for their datasets and precision medicine initiative.  They have social determinants of health surveys and other types of qualitative research to address/better understand non-genetic factors to an individual’s health."" and ""As always, NRHA aims to work with partners such as All of Us to better understand the connection between mental and physical health and increase the representation of underserved populations in health research. That was our goal with this post, though we would be happy to discuss any additional concerns via messenger. Thanks for your feedback and for being such a valuable rural health advocate!"" 

NRHA staff will talk with our engagement counselor and comms lead during our Thursday meeting more about this comment. This is a good reminder that NRHA has more opportunity to get the full message of the full scope of the Program out to our researchers and members. 
The NRHA member expressed in their comment on the post that they understood the Program to strictly define disparities through genetics. Because of this understanding, they believed that NRHA and All of Us were ignoring the social determinants of health that may contribute to the increased levels of anxiety, depression, and substance misuse in LGBTQ+ populations, as compared to heterosexual populations.

NRHA staff member Lea Mann wanted to create a May Monthly report in Network Ninja to review the questions before drafting but could not seem to choose the correct setting in Network Ninja for the monthly report questions to populate. In order to resolve the frustration, Lea went back to the Network Ninja training provided by Pyxis to go through the motions of creating a monthly report while watching the tutorial video. Lea then took notes on the procedure for next month, hoping this will create more ease in June and the further months coming.","Pertaining to the troubleshooting issues in the new version of Network Ninja, NRHA has learned that it is important to slow down and revert to primary trainings, even in the routine reporting process, to ensure that proper and accurate reporting is conducted.

In May, NRHA learned that engaging All of Us Research Program leadership about rural representation in the Program is just as important as engaging rural populations across the country. For example, Dr. Watson presented an alarmingly low statistic on the percentage of rural population enrolled in the Program.  Since engaging with the audience on how and what the Program will do to improve rural enrollment, Dr. Watson has become more enthusiastic about getting the Program more involved with rural instead of just the other way around.","Between April 30, 2022, and May 31, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Spring Engagement Meeting, and the Annual CPGI Network Meeting.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.

Regarding information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the Spring Engagement Meeting, Annual CPGI Meeting, target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us AAPI Heritage Month, Mental Health Awareness Month, National Arab American Heritage Month, and Older Americans Month social media toolkits through our platforms. NRHA also discussed a potential paid co-branded Facebook opportunity with our engagement counselor.  

Most notably, on Thursday, May 12, 2022, NRHA hosted AoU Chief Engagement Officer Dr. Karriem Watson in-person at our Annual Rural Health Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico as the Terry Reilly Keynote Speaker. Dr. Watson presented an information session titled, “The All of Us Research Program: Engaging Rural Communities to Achieve Health Equity.” Dr. Watson successfully engaged an audience of around 200 rural health professionals with his personal journey in precision medicine research and with facts and figures on the All of Us Research Program. The audience was curious to know how the Program can and will do more to engage rural populations. Dr. Watson was able to have honest, reflective answers for the audience on how he sees the program can do more to engage rural populations in the Program. After Dr. Watson’s presentations, NRHA and TX AHEC East Waco Region waited outside the lecture hall with signs that directed the audience to engage with us if they had further questions about the Program.  

As mentioned in previous reports, at NRHA’s Annual Conference, NRHA co-hosted an All of Us Research Program exhibit with TX AHEC East, Waco Region. The Conference boasted a healthy attendance of 843 people. Ashley Bearden and Micah Bolden of TX AHEC East, Waco Region traveled to NM to staff the All of Us booth, along with NRHA staff Laura Hudson and Lea Mann. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla also staffed this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, as needed.  NRHA ordered all the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco provided the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla met with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference.  

In May, NRHA coordinated with our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla and our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett to have Dr. Bennet participate in a panel on May 4, 2022, during the 2022 Spring Engagement Meeting. The panel was titled, “Building a diverse All of Us Researcher Community: Highlights of impactful engagement activities.” In this panel, Program researchers shared their impactful strategies and activities that can be used to inform future work by additional program partners. Dr. Bennett specifically spoke about the barriers when conducting rural health research on the All of Us research workbench. Dr. Bennett expressed the following barriers to conducting precision medicine research in rural populations: availability of data and equitable data; by this Dr. Bennett expanded to say that the datasets never cover all aspects of rural, as smaller areas get lost in the shuffle in larger counties that are urban.

LULAC shared this opportunity with other CPGI partners in the DMV market call and there has been expressed interest in collaborating on this event. LULAC attended the DMV market call on May 17th and shared information about the cafecito event to other CPGI partners for an opportunity to collaborate. LULAC will also be attending the Chicago market call on May 31st. In addition to those meetings, earlier this month LULAC attended the Spring Engagement Meeting. The workshops were very informative and interesting. LULAC also attended the CPGI Meeting. It was interesting to learn more about what strategies and models worked for other CPGI partners. It was also interesting to learn about how the data is collected and given back to the CPGI partners to have a better understanding of their impact."

In partnership with Henry Ford Health and Public Health Society, we hosted a tabling event at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. This event is the beginning of their spring tabling sessions, where they will raise awareness on campus regarding the research project and highlight its significance for biodiversity. 

In addition to the tabling event, further collaboration with Henry Ford and the Public Health Society included our Public Health Careers Webinar. Designed to educate students on various careers in public health, we had 90 people register. With students joining from the 3 metro-Detroit universities, speakers shared their experiences from their inspiration to enter the public health field to discussing integral work being done in the communities around us. Dr. Abdul El-Sayed presented as a keynote speaker and led the way in explaining how diverse the field can be. Both events focused on further engaging students and inviting them to join All of Us and other public health initiatives. 

We have also re-scheduled our food-series event to take place sometime in May. This event will feature a chef with a nutrition background, All of Us/ACCESS representative and a Researcher who will speak to food and culture.

As an avid advocate for greater representation amongst the health field, the All of Us Program takes critical steps in the right direction. Witnessing the shared vision our community partners and collaborators have provided momentum to continue our efforts within the Metro-Detroit community. This program is vast, with numerous opportunities for discussion, sharing knowledge, and building camaraderie in the public health sphere.

- Communications/social media: Monthly social media posts on AAPA/PA Foundation channels - 4/1, 4/7, 4/25. Incorporated messaging related to National Minority Health Month, World Health Day, and social determinants of health (toolkit). Communications article published on AAPA News Central (4/4) - wrap-up/recap of live webinar event featuring All of Us, with CTA to access CME bundle (including recorded webinar and two additional recorded segments) on AAPA Learning Central.

The center continues to develop a better understanding of how AHECs can support the All of Us program through our experience and the opportunities provided by Pyxis to collaborate with AHEC/THEARI and the WA Ecosystem.,,"The main challenge is capacity at this time.  However, the AHEC is actively working to address this issue.","Center capacity has been a challenge this year.  It was expected that center staff would need to be flexible to delivery of media work on virtual and in-person events.  However, the challenges of staffing and hiring during the pandemic were new with many organizations in the AHEC network impacted by the great resignation.  This had internal implications, but also impacted AHEC external partners and contacts. 

The AHEC hired two more part-time hourly staff in March and spent time onboarding and training during the month of April.  This was challenging to administer during our planned travel months for the All of Us Program, but also a positive for the center. Lesly Pumay was added to the All of Us program grant work at the center to support social media work. She is graduating this year with a BFA in Design from Cornish College of Arts.

The center also interviewed candidates and hired one new full-time position to start in May. These efforts will significantly improve center capacity across grant work. The AHECWW continues to push forward identifying strategies to maintain and deliver grant tasks to the best of staff ability and capacity, while addressing any deficiencies","During the Western Forum, Cori Garcia Hansen became ill with an upper respiratory infection.  She was then not allowed to participate in the in-person conference.  However, the AHECWW center sent two staff, so Carlos Morales, was able to cover the event activities.  The AHECWW also had the support of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health.  Overall, the task was delivered successfully.   

As the AHECWW looks forward to the opportunity to continue participation with the All of Us Program, the center has reflected on its niche and role in the work in the WA Ecosystem.  The education and awareness piece seems complimentary to the work to build support among health professionals working in underserved communities.  Ultimately, this will help with recruitment and retention.  We also continue to provide information about the research work bench to the health professions student and professional audience. The AHEC needs to learn more about how to best evaluate and survey participants in programming to serve the other collaborative efforts in the region and goals of the program.  As the development of the WA Ecosystem group is new, the center is optimistic about the opportunities to collaborate and form a streamlined approach with tangible outcomes in support of regional partners.","With the ongoing challenges during the pandemic, the experience with event coverage demonstrated the importance of back-up plans and staffing when unforeseen factors like illness impact the work.","The AHECWW participated in the CPGI Engagement Counseling meeting and the National AHEC Organization All of Us Program presentation.

In regard to information disseminations and CPGI governance activities, NRHA staff member Lea Mann has been able to represent NRHA at the target market meetings, webinars, and sub-awardee meetings. NRHA promoted the All of Us DNA Day and World Health Day social media toolkits through our platforms. NRHA also discussed a potential paid co-branded Facebook opportunity with our engagement counselor, , communications counselor, and internal NRHA staff. Further, NRHA was able to share with its sub-awardees a social media analytics tracking form that is enhancing NRHA’s social media reporting in Network Ninja.  

In Colorado, our sub-awardee the Colorado Rural Health Center (CRHC) held their Annual Rural Health Forum April 6-8, 2022. The Forum provided an opportunity for Colorado’s 55 certified Rural Health Clinics, and other rural providers and healthcare professionals interested in learning more about rural specific healthcare to convene, learn, and network together. NRHA and CRHC wanted to take the opportunity to educate rural providers on what the Program is and why it is safe and important to participate in the All of Us Research Program. NRHA, with the help of our engagement counselor, was able to coordinate an All of Us presence at the Forum, which consisted of Denver Market Coordinator Julia Daverne giving an oral presentation on the AoU Research Program, as well as Ms. Daverne hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit space. It was reported back to NRHA by CRHC that after the Forum, 50% of survey respondents said they would like more sessions on diversity and inclusion in the future, which was a central topic in the AoU Research Program session. Please see the Network Ninja activities log for more information about the exhibit and the session.  Finally, here are highlights Ms. Daverne also shared upon return from the Forum:  

“I just returned from an amazing trip to Denver, CO to speak and exhibit at the Colorado Rural Health Center Forum. I met attendees from various professional backgrounds which included providers/MDs/nurses, a hospital CEO, clinic directors...etc. I had great introductory conversations about the All of Us program while exhibiting. 19 attendees were in my session which was great given the average was about 15 for concurrent sessions. I met many of the attendees at the table and incorporated their stories into the presentation. It was great learning about rural populations! I met Amanda Quintana with NAHN, who was awesome to meet in person. She attended the AoU session and added great supportive AoU commentary to the discussion.” 

On April 25th, NRHA subawardee, the Louisiana Rural Health Association, in accordance with their goals to have a larger social media presence, participated in the DNA Day Twitter Chat with the University of Shreveport in the Shreveport, LA Market. LRHA also shared the All of Us social media observances in April. Those social media engagements have/will be entered into Network Ninja.  

In the El Paso, TX Target Market, Krista Forbes, target market coordinator, has assisted NRHA in identifying existing CHW AoU materials. While NRHA had anticipated being further along in the development of a rural CHW training related to AoU in Cycle 3, we encountered some unforeseen challenges and therefore reallocated some funding to support All of Us Research Program’s presence at NRHA’s Annual Conference.  NRHA has contracted with Janel Lowman, a CHW trainer who has worked with rural CHWS and is familiar with the Program through her position with the University of South Alabama, to develop an outline for rural CHW training from the existing All of Us Research Program slide decks with the sole purpose of educating rural CHWs about the Program. Upon successful completion of this outline in Cycle 3, NRHA proposes to build upon the outline in Cycle 4 to create AoU Research Program training modules for rural CHWs.  

As noted in the previous reports, NRHA is delighted to have Dr. Watson present the Terry Reilly Keynote at the NRHA 2022 Annual Rural Health Conference on Thursday, May 12, 2022 in Albuquerque, NM. We continue to work with our engagement counselor and communications lead to coordinate the All of Us presence at the Annual Conference. Since Dr. Watson is attending the Annual Rural Health Conference, NRHA has been working with CPGI Partner Texas AHEC East, Waco office to finalize details for the co-hosted exhibit. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla will be helping to support this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, if needed. NRHA also plans to engage conference participants directly after Dr. Watson’s presentation to take any additional questions or comments they may have about the AoU Research Program by holding “Ask Me a Question” signs outside of the auditorium. The plans and efforts continue to be ongoing as the date of the Annual Conference is approaching. NRHA has ordered all of the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco will be providing the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla will meet with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference. 

In April, NRHA has been in conversation with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett about coordinating an online seminar based around the All of Us Research Program’s Workbench. This would take place before the end of Cycle 3 – likely in June 2022.  

In Arizona, this month, NRHA met with AZ Rural Health Association leadership to discuss their activities as collaborators for the remainder of Cycle 3 and their interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as subawardees and participants in the developing Arizona Target Market. From this conversation, AzRHA proposed hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit at an upcoming rural health conference in June that AZRHA is co-sponsoring (48th Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference). NRHA and our engagement counselor believe that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Program to Arizona rural health stakeholders. AZRHA is currently working on a Cycle 3 proposal to include this new activity. Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a subawardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. They mentioned having a podcast series in which they would be happy to feature information and figures from the Program to familiarize their audience with the Program. They suggested maybe including other California CPGI, HPO, or National Partners on the podcast. NRHA is waiting to hear back from the president, who was seeking approval from the full CSRHA Board.",,"NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general.","There are challenges that we hope to explore in Cycle 4: When working with trusted community partners like providers or other groups, what type of information do they need to feel comfortable sharing about the importance of enrollment in the AoU Program? What would make a provider recommend this program to a patient? How can NRHA assist in coordinating these types of discussions between rural providers and the Program? How can NRHA better identify UBR groups within rural (I.e., someone who is a person of color living in rural America or an LGBTQ+ person living in rural America), essentially how do we take into better account the intersectional identities of people that cause them to be further underrepresented in biomedical precision research?","NRHA was hoping to All of Us Research Program promotional giveaways at the CRHC 2022 Forum,   unfortunately there was a technical glitch that caused the order not to be processed. When the CRHC order modification was submitted in the system, it did not alert the appropriate staff person as it was designed to do; therefore that the modified was not processed. NRHA was alerted by our engagement counselor that the items did not get shipped in time because of the glitch. NRHA and Pyxis have decided to ship those giveaways to a future NRHA or subawardee in-person All of Us event. We appreciate our engagement counselor and the system monitor’s help in figuring out the issue and working to correct it in the system.  

As mentioned in the accomplishments section, NRHA had planned to have developed the rural community health worker training activity further this cycle, but staff transition and the realization that the type of CHW materials we were looking for did not exist, have delayed our progress on this activity. However, a CHW trainer is now developing an outline for a CHW training using the approved AoU Research Program slide deck. We plan to build upon that work in our proposed scope of work for Cycle 4. In consultation with our engagement counselor, funding that had been set aside for the CHW trainer was reallocated to support AoU’s session at NRHA’s Annual Conference.","NRHA has learned that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals can lead to success! On the other side of this lesson is that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals requires patience, flexibility, and open communication. Unfortunately, we were unable to have the promotional giveaways at the Forum, but now have also learned an important lesson to follow up after submission to confirm receipt and that there is always a way to repurpose materials.","Between March, 31, 2022, and April 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Researchers Convention, all Cycle 4 planning meetings and all other virtual events held by the Program.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,MSR,0,Admin,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,"April of Cycle 3 has been a busy month for NRHA as we finalized our Cycle 4 Strategy document while also finalizing the remaining Cycle 3 activities.

NRHA has contracted with Janel Lowman, a CHW trainer who has worked with rural CHWS and is familiar with the Program through her position with the University of South Alabama, to develop an outline for rural CHW training from the existing All of Us Research Program slide decks with the sole purpose of educating rural CHWs about the Program. Upon successful completion of this outline in Cycle 3, NRHA proposes to build upon the outline in Cycle 4 to create AoU Research Program training modules for rural CHWs.  

As noted in the previous reports, NRHA is delighted to have Dr. Watson present the Terry Reilly Keynote at the NRHA 2022 Annual Rural Health Conference on Thursday, May 12, 2022 in Albuquerque, NM. We continue to work with our engagement counselor and communications lead to coordinate the All of Us presence at the Annual Conference. Since Dr. Watson is attending the Annual Rural Health Conference, NRHA has been working with CPGI Partner Texas AHEC East, Waco office to finalize details for the co-hosted exhibit. Our Engagement Counselor Rachelle Ciulla will be helping to support this exhibit while also assisting Dr. Watson on-site, if needed. NRHA also plans to engage conference participants directly after Dr. Watson’s presentation to take any additional questions or comments they may have about the AoU Research Program by holding “Ask Me a Question” signs outside of the auditorium. The plans and efforts continue to be ongoing as the date of the Annual Conference is approaching. NRHA has ordered all of the Program promotional materials, as well as general exhibit assets, including a table runner & a vertical banner, needed for the conference. Texas AHEC East- Waco will be providing the printed materials. Also, Ms. Ciulla will meet with the state rural health association leaders briefly during their convening within the NRHA conference. 

In April, NRHA has been in conversation with our “Rural Research Influencer” Dr. Kevin Bennett about coordinating an online seminar based around the All of Us Research Program’s Workbench. This would take place before the end of Cycle 3 – likely in June 2022.  

In Arizona, this month, NRHA met with AZ Rural Health Association leadership to discuss their activities as collaborators for the remainder of Cycle 3 and their interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as subawardees and participants in the developing Arizona Target Market. From this conversation, AzRHA proposed hosting an All of Us Research Program exhibit at an upcoming rural health conference in June that AZRHA is co-sponsoring (48th Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference). NRHA and our engagement counselor believe that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce the Program to Arizona rural health stakeholders. AZRHA is currently working on a Cycle 3 proposal to include this new activity. Moreover, the current board president of AZRHA, Elizabeth Hall -Lipsey, JD, had the brilliant idea of working with preceptors in rural areas as a way of increasing the Program’s engagement with providers and trusted health professionals in rural areas. Their involvement would also increase the involvement of the students they are working with. Both groups could then also educate and engage their clientele about the All of Us Research Program. NRHA looks forward to discussing this further in our Cycle 4 Scope of Work.   

In California, this month, NRHA met with CA State Rural Health Association president Scott Hertzberg to discuss CSRHA’s interest in a small activity as a collaborator before the end of Cycle 3 and CSRHA’s interest in participating in NRHA’s Cycle 4 programming with All of Us as a subawardee in the developing California Target Market. The conversation was fruitful, as the leadership was very interested to participate in All of Us programming. They mentioned having a podcast series in which they would be happy to feature information and figures from the Program to familiarize their audience with the Program. They suggested maybe including other California CPGI, HPO, or National Partners on the podcast. NRHA is waiting to hear back from the president, who was seeking approval from the full CSRHA Board.","NRHA was hoping to All of Us Research Program promotional giveaways at the CRHC 2022 Forum,   unfortunately there was a technical glitch that caused the order not to be processed. When the CRHC order modification was submitted in the system, it did not alert the appropriate staff person as it was designed to do; therefore that the modified was not processed. NRHA was alerted by our engagement counselor that the items did not get shipped in time because of the glitch. NRHA and Pyxis have decided to ship those giveaways to a future NRHA or subawardee in-person All of Us event. We appreciate our engagement counselor and the system monitor’s help in figuring out the issue and working to correct it in the system.  

As mentioned in the accomplishments section, NRHA had planned to have developed the rural community health worker training activity further this cycle, but staff transition and the realization that the type of CHW materials we were looking for did not exist, have delayed our progress on this activity. However, a CHW trainer is now developing an outline for a CHW training using the approved AoU Research Program slide deck. We plan to build upon that work in our proposed scope of work for Cycle 4. In consultation with our engagement counselor, funding that had been set aside for the CHW trainer was reallocated to support AoU’s session at NRHA’s Annual Conference.","NRHA has learned that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals can lead to success! On the other side of this lesson is that collaboration and maintaining reachable goals requires patience, flexibility, and open communication. Unfortunately, we were unable to have the promotional giveaways at the Forum, but now have also learned an important lesson to follow up after submission to confirm receipt and that there is always a way to repurpose materials.","NRHA continues to discuss the geographic and socioeconomic barriers individuals who live in rural areas face when attempting to participate in research such as the All of Us Research Program. NRHA has appreciated being able to discuss this with the Arizona HPO (Health Care Provider Organization), the Colorado Rural Health Center, and both groups’ engagement counselors. NRHA has discussed with the Comms team and the East Texas AHEC Waco about the best ways to share information with interested individuals specific to their geographic area at the AoU exhibit at NRHA’s Annual Conference and in general.","Working with trusted community partners like providers, potentially other health professional preceptors, or other groups already located within the community is a wonderful way to encourage engagement and enrollment.","There are challenges that we hope to explore in Cycle 4: When working with trusted community partners like providers or other groups, what type of information do they need to feel comfortable sharing about the importance of enrollment in the AoU Program? What would make a provider recommend this program to a patient? How can NRHA assist in coordinating these types of discussions between rural providers and the Program? How can NRHA better identify UBR groups within rural (I.e., someone who is a person of color living in rural America or an LGBTQ+ person living in rural America), essentially how do we take into better account the intersectional identities of people that cause them to be further underrepresented in biomedical precision research?",,"Between March, 31, 2022, and April 30, 2022, NRHA has communicated with our engagement counselor, Rachelle Ciulla, weekly. NRHA has worked with sub-awardees on activities and had internal discussions about sub-awardee priorities related to the project including considering additional target markets for the next cycle proposal. Internal meetings have also been discussed regarding upcoming communication activities.  NRHA staff were able to attend all Target Market meetings, the All of Us Researchers Convention, all Cycle 4 planning meetings and all other virtual events held by the Program."

Also encouraged our individual members to start to consider more people facing events by following the CDC guideline locally. Assisted with the Rooted and Resilience core planning by doing a site visit in Atlanta and walking the location. Ordered necessary needed items like the tent, tables, and chairs from one of the local vendors. Received assets from previous locations to store for the event along with assisting with the transport of the items to the events. Worked the Rooted in Resilience events on Friday and Saturday as well as met with individual vendors for the on-site community event. Assisted with the on-site logistics along with the setup and breakdown process. Communicated with the vendors for transport of items like staging, tents, port potties, etc as well as pick up of those items after the event ended."

We worked to submit the CPGI Engagement Strategy report and this highlighted our key goals to come. As we reflected on the events and successes we had in the last year, we identified practices and methods of recruitment and education that were beneficial to our community.","Our concerns for May are key worries carried over from April. With growing interest to reintegrate in-person social events and communications, the pandemic continues to fluctuate. We will continue to remain respectful of the community surrounding us and navigate in-person events cautiously.",,"Annual CPGI Meeting 2022, NAT Photoshoot Activation: Detroit Webinar"
