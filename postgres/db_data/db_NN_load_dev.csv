Us awareness campaign.  The series will continue through May when we launch our Mental Health series.
●	The amount of time it takes to have products reviewed can pose a challenge to event success if not received back in a timely fashion. Therefore, we worked hard to provide early and advanced notice of our May activities so that we could receive approvals in time for scheduled promotional activities.
●	Our team continues to meet regularly to fine-tune the plans within our Scope of Work and to address any service gaps in programming, while also looking for opportunities to share this information with wider audiences in the community at large.","●	Competing demands on the team’s time due to other responsibilities are weighing heavy. Constant communication as well as being able to quickly pivot will ensure the team’s success throughout the duration of the project.",,The All of Us Research Program seeks to have a diverse database so that drugs and medicines can be developed using research compiled from people of all backgrounds.,,"●	Sigma Gamma Rho’s social media campaign has provided a consistent presence of promotion of the program on all of our social media channels.  As we continue to collect “health stories” from members of the organization, and also publicize All of Us on social media, we are anticipating an increase in followers and thereby reaching more people with our messages. We also began promoting our May Self Care Mental Health - All of Us webinar that will be coming up in May.
●	Our Atlanta team assisted with the Rooted in Resilience Tour this month, which helped to gain greater visibility in that market, as well as to strengthen community partnerships which we hope will lead to future events. Each tour stop includes three components: education with an HBCU, community, and faith partners. Details about the three events are available at www.rootedinresilience.com. The flyer for this month’s event is also attached.
●	We continue to brainstorm how to leverage the partnerships and resources we are learning about to the benefit of getting the word out about All of us, and we continue to fine-tune the plans within the Scope of Work to ensure ease and readiness of execution at the appropriate time.",,,,Decatur,GA
